# Genesis Bootstrap Remediation Plan

---

# 1. Purpose

This document defines the official remediation activities required after the independent Bootstrap Audit.

It transforms accepted findings into engineering work items.

It does not modify audit conclusions.

It defines how the repository reaches Bootstrap Certification.

---

# 2. Guiding Principle

External audits never modify the repository.

Repository evolution is always controlled internally.

Therefore:

Audit

↓

Official Response

↓

Remediation Plan

↓

Implementation

↓

Re-Audit

↓

Certification

# 3. Accepted Findings

The following findings are accepted for remediation.

## Repository consistency

- duplicate folders
- obsolete paths
- metadata inconsistencies

Status

Pending

---

## Architecture alignment

Review ARCHITECTURE_MAP consistency.

Status

Pending

---

## Governance traceability

Improve CHANGELOG coverage.

Status

Pending

---

## Metadata standardization

Standardize document headers where applicable.

# 4. Findings Not Accepted

The following findings are considered outside Bootstrap scope.

## Runtime validation

Rejected.

Genesis Bootstrap certifies governance.

Not software implementation.

---

## Operational readiness

Rejected.

No runtime exists yet.

---

## Platform readiness

Deferred.

Will be evaluated after MVP.

---

## Data readiness

Deferred.

Depends on product implementation.

---

## Observability

Deferred.

Depends on runtime.

---

## Scalability

Deferred.

Depends on production software.

# 5. Remediation Phases

## Phase 1

Repository consistency

Priority

Critical

---

## Phase 2

Governance consistency

Priority

High

---

## Phase 3

Architecture synchronization

Priority

High

---

## Phase 4

Metadata normalization

Priority

Medium

---

## Phase 5

Bootstrap Re-Audit

Priority

Critical

---

# 6. Completion Criteria

The remediation phase is complete when:

- accepted findings resolved

- documentation updated

- Architecture Map synchronized

- metadata standardized

- repository internally reviewed

---

# 7. Out of Scope

This remediation does not include:

- application development

- software implementation

- APIs

- databases

- infrastructure

- cloud deployment

- runtime validation

---

# 8. Deliverables

The remediation process produces:

- updated repository

- updated governance documentation

- Bootstrap Re-Audit

- Bootstrap Certification

---

# 9. Success Criteria

Bootstrap will be considered complete when:

- accepted findings resolved

- deferred findings documented

- rejected findings justified

- repository passes independent re-audit

- Genesis Certification can be issued
