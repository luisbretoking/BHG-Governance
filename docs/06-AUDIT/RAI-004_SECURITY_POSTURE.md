# 1. Audit Objective

This audit evaluates the security posture of the repository according to the
Repository Audit Intelligence framework.

The objective is to determine whether the repository establishes adequate
security foundations through:

- Secure development principles.
- Security documentation.
- Risk awareness.
- Controlled engineering practices.
- Protection-oriented architecture decisions.


---

# 2. Audit Scope

The evaluation covers:

- Security documentation.
- Secure development standards.
- Repository security practices.
- Sensitive information handling.
- Security governance alignment.
- Development lifecycle controls.


This audit does not evaluate:

- External penetration testing.
- Production infrastructure security.
- Third-party vendor security.
- Legal compliance certification.


---

# 3. Audit Methodology

The assessment follows the RAI security evaluation process:

1. Review security governance documents.
2. Analyze security-related standards.
3. Identify existing controls.
4. Evaluate security maturity.
5. Document findings and recommendations.

# 4. Security Posture Criteria

| Criterion | Description |
|---|---|
| Security Governance | Security principles are documented and accessible |
| Secure Development | Engineering practices include security considerations |
| Data Protection | Sensitive information handling principles exist |
| Risk Management | Security risks can be identified and tracked |
| Security Traceability | Security decisions are documented |

# 5. Findings


## RAI-004-F001

**Category:** Security Governance  
**Severity:** Medium  
**Status:** Resolved


### Finding

Security principles existed as engineering concepts but required formal integration
into the audit governance structure.


### Impact

Without explicit audit visibility, security practices may become inconsistent as
the system expands.


### Resolution

Established security posture evaluation as a formal RAI audit dimension.

Integrated security evaluation with:

- Security documentation.
- Engineering standards.
- Architecture governance.


### Result

Security is now recognized as a controlled engineering responsibility.


---

## RAI-004-F002

**Category:** Security Automation  
**Severity:** Low  
**Status:** Open


### Finding

The repository does not yet include automated security validation processes.


### Impact

Manual verification may become insufficient as repository complexity grows.


### Recommendation

Future implementation should consider:

- Dependency vulnerability scanning.
- Secret detection.
- Static analysis.
- Security checks in CI/CD pipelines.


### Result

Security foundation is established, automation remains a future improvement.

# 6. Security Posture Assessment


## Security Maturity

Assessment:

**Level: Medium-High**


The repository demonstrates:

- Security awareness.
- Documentation-driven governance.
- Secure design principles.


Remaining improvements:

- Automated security controls.
- Continuous security monitoring.
- Security testing workflows.


---

# 7. Audit Conclusion

The repository establishes an adequate security foundation according to the
current maturity level of Ziva Engineering System.

Future growth requires increasing automation and continuous security validation
to maintain protection as system complexity increases.
