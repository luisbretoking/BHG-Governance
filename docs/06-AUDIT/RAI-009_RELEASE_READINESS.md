# 1. Audit Objective

This audit evaluates release readiness within the repository according to the
Repository Audit Intelligence framework.

The objective is to determine whether the repository supports controlled
software releases through:

- Defined release processes.
- Version management.
- Change traceability.
- Quality validation.
- Deployment preparation.


---

# 2. Audit Scope

The evaluation covers:

- Release documentation.
- Versioning practices.
- Change management.
- Release lifecycle.
- Validation requirements.
- Deployment readiness principles.


This audit does not evaluate:

- Production deployment infrastructure.
- External hosting providers.
- User acceptance testing.
- Business release decisions.


---

# 3. Audit Methodology

The assessment follows the RAI release evaluation process:

1. Review release documentation.
2. Analyze version management practices.
3. Evaluate change traceability.
4. Verify release governance.
5. Document findings.

# 4. Release Readiness Criteria

| Criterion | Description |
|---|---|
| Version Control | Releases follow identifiable versions |
| Change Traceability | Changes can be mapped to commits and documents |
| Validation Process | Releases include verification steps |
| Documentation Update | Release changes are documented |
| Rollback Awareness | Recovery considerations exist |

# 5. Findings


## RAI-009-F001

**Category:** Release Governance  
**Severity:** Medium  
**Status:** Resolved


### Finding

Release management principles existed but required a formal audit dimension to
validate readiness before future deployments.


### Impact

Without release validation, future changes may introduce:

- Incomplete documentation.
- Untracked modifications.
- Deployment risks.


### Resolution

Established release readiness as a formal RAI assessment dimension.

The evaluation verifies:

- Version practices.
- Documentation updates.
- Change traceability.
- Validation requirements.


### Result

Release preparation now has a defined governance framework.


---

## RAI-009-F002

**Category:** Release Automation  
**Severity:** Low  
**Status:** Open


### Finding

Automated release pipelines are not yet part of the current repository
maturity stage.


### Impact

Manual release procedures may become inefficient as the ecosystem grows.


### Recommendation

Future improvements:

- Automated CI/CD pipelines.
- Automated testing gates.
- Release approval workflows.
- Deployment validation.


### Result

Release governance foundation exists; automation remains a future improvement.

# 6. Release Readiness Assessment


## Release Maturity

Assessment:

**Level: Medium-High**


The repository demonstrates:

- Controlled change principles.
- Documentation-driven releases.
- Traceable engineering practices.


Remaining improvements:

- Automated release workflows.
- Deployment validation.
- Release monitoring.


---

# 7. Audit Conclusion

The repository has sufficient foundations for controlled releases at the
current development stage.

Future production maturity requires increasing automation and validation
capabilities to ensure reliable delivery at scale.


---

# 8. Next Recommended Audits

Future RAI assessments:

- RAI-010_CONTINUOUS_IMPROVEMENT.md
- RAI-011_ENGINEERING_MATURITY.md
- RAI-012_AI_READINESS.md
