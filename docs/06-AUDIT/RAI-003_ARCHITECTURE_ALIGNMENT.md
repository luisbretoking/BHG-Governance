# 1. Audit Objective

This audit evaluates architectural alignment within the repository according to
the Repository Audit Intelligence framework.

The objective is to determine whether the current architecture supports:

- Clear system boundaries.
- Separation of responsibilities.
- Scalability principles.
- Maintainability.
- Long-term engineering evolution.


---

# 2. Audit Scope

The evaluation covers:

- Architectural documentation.
- Component relationships.
- System boundaries.
- Design decisions.
- Repository architecture representation.
- Alignment with ZES principles.


This audit does not evaluate:

- Runtime performance.
- Production infrastructure.
- Business metrics.
- User adoption.


---

# 3. Audit Methodology

The assessment follows the RAI architecture evaluation process:

1. Review architecture documentation.
2. Analyze component organization.
3. Verify decision traceability.
4. Evaluate separation of concerns.
5. Classify findings.

# 4. Architecture Integrity Criteria

| Criterion | Description |
|---|---|
| Boundary Definition | Systems and components have clear responsibilities |
| Separation of Concerns | Components avoid unnecessary coupling |
| Documentation Alignment | Architecture matches documented design |
| Decision Traceability | Architectural decisions are recorded |
| Scalability Readiness | Design supports future evolution |

# 5. Findings


## RAI-003-F001

**Category:** Architecture Documentation  
**Severity:** Medium  
**Status:** Resolved


### Finding

Architectural concepts existed across multiple documents and required stronger
centralization.


### Impact

Fragmented architecture information increases the risk of:

- Conflicting interpretations.
- Duplicate decisions.
- Implementation divergence.


### Resolution

Established architecture documentation as the source of truth through:

- Architecture maps.
- ADR records.
- System design documentation.


### Result

Architecture decisions now have a defined documentation path.


---

## RAI-003-F002

**Category:** Component Boundaries  
**Severity:** Medium  
**Status:** Monitoring


### Finding

Future product expansion requires maintaining strict separation between:

- Core infrastructure.
- Business domains.
- User-facing applications.
- External integrations.


### Impact

Poor boundary management could increase technical debt as the ecosystem grows.


### Recommendation

Maintain architectural boundaries through:

- Modular design.
- Explicit interfaces.
- ADR approval for major structural changes.


### Result

Architecture alignment is acceptable with continuous governance required.

# 6. Architecture Alignment Assessment


## Architectural Maturity

Assessment:

**Level: Medium-High**


The repository demonstrates:

- Strong architectural intent.
- Governance-oriented design.
- Documentation-driven decisions.


Remaining improvements:

- Increase architecture automation.
- Add architecture validation processes.
- Maintain updated system diagrams.


---

# 7. Audit Conclusion

The repository architecture is aligned with the foundational principles of Ziva
Engineering System.

The current architecture provides a suitable foundation for continued
development, provided future changes maintain documented decisions and clear
component boundaries.

# 8. Next Recommended Audits

Future RAI assessments:

- RAI-004_SECURITY_POSTURE.md
- RAI-005_GOVERNANCE_COMPLIANCE.md
- RAI-006_OPERATIONAL_READINESS.md
