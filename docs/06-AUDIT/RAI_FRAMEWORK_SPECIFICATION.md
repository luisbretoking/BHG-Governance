# 1. Purpose

The Repository Audit Intelligence (RAI) Framework defines the standard methodology used to evaluate repository integrity, documentation quality, architectural alignment, security posture, governance compliance and operational readiness.

RAI transforms repository analysis from an informal review process into a structured, repeatable and traceable audit system.

The purpose of this framework is to provide objective visibility into repository maturity and identify gaps before production implementation.


---

# 2. Scope

The RAI Framework applies to:

- Software repositories.
- Documentation repositories.
- Engineering governance systems.
- Infrastructure definitions.
- Application architecture.
- Security configurations.
- Operational processes.

RAI does not replace engineering reviews, security assessments or compliance audits.

It provides an intelligence layer that organizes, evaluates and documents repository state.


---

# 3. Core Principles

## 3.1 Documentation First

Every audit decision must be traceable to documented evidence.

## 3.2 Evidence-Based Evaluation

RAI assessments must rely on observable repository artifacts.

## 3.3 Repeatability

Audits must produce consistent results when executed under the same conditions.

## 3.4 Traceability

Every finding must reference:

- Location.
- Evidence.
- Impact.
- Recommendation.
- Resolution status.

# 4. Framework Architecture

RAI consists of multiple audit layers:

# 5. Audit Components

## 5.1 Repository Integrity

Evaluates:

- Folder structure.
- File organization.
- Naming conventions.
- Missing references.
- Broken paths.
- Structural consistency.


## 5.2 Documentation Integrity

Evaluates:

- Documentation completeness.
- Metadata consistency.
- Cross-reference validity.
- Version alignment.
- Governance coverage.


## 5.3 Architecture Alignment

Evaluates:

- Architectural consistency.
- Separation of concerns.
- Component relationships.
- Technical decision alignment.


## 5.4 Security Assessment

Evaluates:

- Security controls.
- Exposure risks.
- Configuration safety.
- Secure development practices.


## 5.5 Governance Compliance

Evaluates:

- Policy adoption.
- ADR compliance.
- Decision traceability.
- Engineering standards adherence.

# 6. Audit Document Standard

Every RAI audit document must include:

- Document metadata.
- Audit objective.
- Scope.
- Evaluation criteria.
- Findings.
- Severity classification.
- Recommendations.
- Resolution tracking.


---

# 7. Severity Classification

RAI findings use the following classification:

## Critical

Issues capable of causing severe operational, security or architectural impact.

## High

Issues requiring priority remediation.

## Medium

Issues affecting maintainability, scalability or governance.

## Low

Minor inconsistencies or optimization opportunities.


---

# 8. Audit Lifecycle

RAI follows this lifecycle:

1. Define audit scope.
2. Collect repository evidence.
3. Evaluate against framework criteria.
4. Document findings.
5. Assign severity.
6. Create remediation plan.
7. Validate resolution.


---

# 9. Relationship With Ziva Engineering System

RAI operates as an audit intelligence layer inside ZES.

Its responsibility is not to create software components but to provide governance visibility over engineering artifacts.

RAI supports:

- Engineering quality.
- Repository maturity.
- Documentation reliability.
- Long-term maintainability.


---

# 10. Future Extensions

The framework may evolve with:

- Automated repository scanning.
- AI-assisted analysis.
- Continuous audit pipelines.
- Compliance mappings.
- Engineering maturity scoring.


---

# 11. Change Control

All modifications to this specification must follow:

- Architecture Decision Records.
- Documentation governance rules.
- Conventional Commit standards.
