# Versioning Policy

## Purpose

This policy establishes the official versioning framework for every governance artifact, engineering asset, repository, software component, artificial intelligence model and knowledge asset managed within the Breto's Holding Group ecosystem.

Its purpose is to ensure that every change remains understandable, traceable, auditable and reproducible throughout the complete lifecycle of the ecosystem.

Versioning is considered a fundamental governance mechanism rather than a software-only practice.

---

# Scope

This policy applies to:

- governance documents;
- repositories;
- software;
- APIs;
- artificial intelligence models;
- BKOs;
- BEiA;
- standards;
- policies;
- procedures;
- products;
- services;
- knowledge bases;
- operational assets managed under BHG governance.

---

# Normative Authority

## Governed By

This policy derives its authority from:

- BHG Constitution
- Governance Model
- Legal Hierarchy
- Policy Hierarchy
- Document Policy
- Change Policy

## Governs

This policy governs every versioning practice implemented throughout the BHG ecosystem, including standards, procedures and operational implementations related to version management.

---

# Core Principles

## Principle 1 — Every Asset Has a Version

Every institutional asset shall possess an explicit and uniquely identifiable version.

No governance artifact shall exist without version information.

---

## Principle 2 — History Shall Never Be Lost

Historical versions constitute institutional knowledge.

Previous versions shall remain preserved for governance, audit, legal and historical purposes.

No approved version shall be deleted.

---

## Principle 3 — Version Numbers Reflect Change Impact

Version identifiers shall accurately represent the magnitude of the implemented change.

Artificial version inflation shall be avoided.

Version numbering shall communicate governance significance.

# Official Versioning Model

All governance artifacts managed within the BHG ecosystem shall use the official Semantic Versioning format:

```
MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH
```

Example:

```
2.4.1
```

The version number shall communicate the governance significance of every approved change.

---

# Version Increment Rules

## MAJOR (X.0.0)

Increment the MAJOR version when introducing changes that significantly modify the governance, architecture or compatibility of an asset.

Typical examples include:

- constitutional changes;
- architectural redesigns;
- incompatible governance changes;
- major repository restructuring;
- removal of previously supported capabilities;
- governance model redesign.

MAJOR version changes shall normally require governance approval at the appropriate authority level.

---

## MINOR (1.X.0)

Increment the MINOR version when introducing new capabilities that remain compatible with previous versions.

Examples include:

- new governance sections;
- additional standards;
- new procedures;
- compatible policy extensions;
- new documentation chapters;
- additional governance controls.

Backward compatibility shall be preserved whenever possible.

---

## PATCH (1.0.X)

Increment the PATCH version when introducing changes that do not alter the intended behavior of the asset.

Examples include:

- editorial corrections;
- clarification of requirements;
- grammar improvements;
- formatting improvements;
- typo corrections;
- reference updates;
- metadata corrections;
- non-functional documentation improvements.

PATCH releases shall not introduce governance-breaking behavior.

---

# Asset Lifecycle Status

Every governed asset shall explicitly declare its lifecycle status.

The official status values are:

- Concept
- Draft
- Review
- Approved
- Active
- Deprecated
- Archived

Status transitions shall remain fully traceable.

Lifecycle status shall be independent from version numbering.

---

# Compatibility Requirements

Every new version shall explicitly document:

- compatibility with previous versions;
- incompatible changes;
- affected governance artifacts;
- affected repositories;
- dependency changes;
- migration requirements;
- implementation considerations.

Whenever compatibility cannot be preserved, migration guidance shall be provided.

---

# Version History

Every governed asset shall preserve a minimum version history containing:

- version identifier;
- publication date;
- responsible governance authority;
- summary of changes;
- approval reference;
- implementation reference, when applicable;
- audit reference, when applicable.

Version history shall remain permanently available for governance and audit purposes.

---

# Document Versioning

Governance documents shall follow the same versioning principles applied to software assets.

Documentation is considered an engineering and governance asset.

Documentation versioning shall support:

- traceability;
- governance evolution;
- dependency management;
- historical reconstruction.

---

# Repository Versioning

Every governed repository shall explicitly declare:

- repository version;
- supported governance baseline;
- compatibility information;
- principal dependencies;
- latest approved release date;
- governance maturity status.

Repository versioning shall remain consistent with the governance documentation contained within the repository.

# BKOs Compatibility

BKOs shall use this policy to:

- identify the current approved version of every governed asset;
- reconstruct complete version histories;
- compare historical versions;
- identify compatibility relationships;
- detect version inconsistencies;
- recommend migration strategies;
- preserve governance traceability across version changes.

BKOs shall treat version history as institutional knowledge.

---

# BEiA Compatibility

Authorized AI systems, including BEiA, may use this policy to:

- explain the evolution of governance artifacts;
- analyze version impacts;
- identify obsolete versions;
- recommend upgrade paths;
- generate executive reports regarding governance maturity;
- assist version comparison.

AI recommendations shall remain advisory.

Final governance authority always belongs to authorized human governance bodies.

---

# Governance as Code

Version information shall be machine-readable.

Governance automation may:

- validate version formats;
- verify lifecycle status transitions;
- detect inconsistent version increments;
- identify missing version metadata;
- compare dependency compatibility;
- generate version reports;
- monitor repository version consistency.

Automation supports governance.

Human authority governs governance.

---

# Audit

Every version modification shall be fully auditable.

Audit evidence shall include, at minimum:

- previous version;
- new version;
- change classification;
- approval authority;
- implementation date;
- supporting governance decision;
- affected artifacts;
- related repository.

Version changes without sufficient evidence shall be considered governance non-conformities.

---

# Compliance

Every governed asset shall comply with this Versioning Policy.

Assets that:

- omit version information;
- use invalid version formats;
- contain inconsistent lifecycle states;
- modify version history without authorization;
- violate approved versioning rules;

shall be considered governance non-conformities and shall follow the Governance Conflict Resolution process.

---

# Final Principle

Versioning is not merely a numbering system.

Versioning preserves the institutional history of Breto's Holding Group.

Every approved version represents a traceable milestone in the evolution of the ecosystem, enabling knowledge continuity, governance integrity and sustainable long-term growth.
