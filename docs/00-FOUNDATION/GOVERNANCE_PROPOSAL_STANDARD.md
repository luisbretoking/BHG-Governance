# Governance Proposal Standard

> Official standard defining the mandatory structure for governance proposals inside Breto's Holding Group.

---

# Purpose

This standard defines the mandatory structure required for every governance proposal submitted within the BHG ecosystem.

Its objective is to guarantee consistency, traceability, evidence-based evaluation and compatibility with human and Artificial Intelligence governance systems.

Every governance proposal shall comply with this standard before entering the Governance Pipeline.

---

# Scope

This standard applies to every governance proposal created within:

- BHG Governance;
- Holding companies;
- Subholdings;
- Subsidiaries;
- Governance committees;
- Authorized governance participants.

No governance proposal may advance through the Governance Pipeline without satisfying this standard.

---

# Core Principles

## Principle 1 — Documentation Before Decision

Every governance proposal shall exist as an official documented artifact before evaluation.

---

## Principle 2 — Unique Identification

Every proposal shall have a unique identifier allowing complete lifecycle traceability.

---

## Principle 3 — Evidence-Based Evaluation

Every proposal shall include sufficient evidence supporting the proposed change.

---

## Principle 4 — Complete Traceability

Every proposal shall preserve:

- origin;
- review history;
- approval authority;
- implementation status;
- audit references.

---

## Principle 5 — Human Review Authority

Artificial Intelligence systems may support proposal analysis but human governance bodies retain exclusive approval authority.

---

# Mandatory Proposal Structure

Every Governance Proposal shall contain the following sections.

---

# 1. Proposal Identifier

Unique identifier assigned to the proposal.

Example:
GP-2026-0001

# 2. Proposal Title

A clear and concise description of the proposed governance change.

---

# 3. Proposal Type

The proposal shall classify itself using one of the following types:

- Constitution
- Governance Model
- Authority

- Standard
- Procedure
- Engineering
- AI
- Security
- Documentation

- Other

---

# 4. Proposal Status

Allowed lifecycle states:

- Draft
- Under Review
- Approved
- Rejected

---

# 5. Proposer

---

# 6. Business Justification

# 10. Impact Assessment

- Operations;
- Documentation;
- AI Systems;
- Companies;
- Subholdings;
- Repositories.

---

# 11. Risk Assessment

Potential risks shall be documented.

- description;
- probability;
- impact;
- mitigation strategy.

---

# 12. AI Assessment

Authorized Artificial Intelligence systems may provide advisory analysis.

Possible assessments include:

- consistency analysis;
- dependency analysis;
- conflict detection;
- historical comparison;
- implementation recommendations.

AI assessment does not represent governance approval.

---

# 13. Human Review

Reserved section for authorized governance reviewers.

Reviewers may:

- request modifications;
- approve progression;
- reject proposals;
- request additional evidence.

---

# 14. Approval Decision

Only authorized governance bodies may issue final decisions.

Allowed values:

- Approved
- Approved with Changes

- Deferred

Every decision shall include:

- approving authority;
- date;
- version reference.

---

# 15. Implementation Plan

Defines how an approved proposal will be executed.

# 16. Audit Information

Every implemented proposal shall preserve:

- approval authority;
- approval date;

- audit reference.

---

# Proposal Lifecycle

Every Governance Proposal shall follow the official Governance Pipeline.

The lifecycle is:
Proposal Creation

↓

Validation

↓

Review

↓

Analysis

↓

Approval

↓

Implementation

↓

Verification

Audit

↓

Closure

No proposal may bypass the established lifecycle unless an approved emergency governance procedure applies.

---

# Artificial Intelligence Participation

Authorized AI systems may:

- prepare proposal drafts;
- validate completeness;
- analyze dependencies;
- detect conflicts;
- estimate impacts;
- recommend improvements.

AI systems shall never:

- approve proposals;
- reject proposals;
- modify official governance artifacts;
- bypass governance authority.

---

# Governance as Code Compatibility

Governance proposals shall be structured for automated validation.

Mandatory metadata and lifecycle fields shall be machine-readable.

Incomplete proposals shall fail automated validation before governance review.

Automation supports governance.

Human authority governs governance.

---

# Compliance

Any governance proposal that does not comply with this standard shall be returned for correction before entering the Governance Pipeline.
