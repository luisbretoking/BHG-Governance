# AI Agent Permission Model

> Official Permission Framework for Artificial Intelligence Agents operating within Breto's Holding Group.

---

# Purpose

This model defines how permissions are assigned, inherited, restricted, verified and revoked for AI agents operating within the BHG ecosystem.

Permissions represent organizational authorization rather than technical capability.

An AI agent may possess the capability to perform an action while lacking organizational permission to execute it.

---

# Permission Principles

The permission model is governed by:

- Human Authority
- Least Privilege
- Governance First
- Explicit Authorization
- Complete Traceability
- Separation of Duties
- Continuous Verification
- Revocable Access

---

# Permission Architecture

Permissions are determined by five independent factors.

```

Certification

Capabilities

# Permission Categories

Permissions are grouped into operational domains.

## Repository Permissions

- Read
- Search
- Index
- Analyze
- Clone Metadata

---

## Documentation Permissions

- Draft
- Suggest
- Edit Proposal
- Format
- Validate References

---

## Engineering Permissions

- Analyze Code
- Review Code
- Generate Code
- Prepare Pull Requests
- Execute Tests

---

## Governance Permissions

- Analyze Governance
- Detect Conflicts
- Validate Standards
- Produce Governance Reports

Governance approval permissions shall never be granted.

---

## Automation Permissions

- Execute Approved Workflows
- Validate Metadata
- Verify Compliance
- Execute Scheduled Tasks

---

## Security Permissions

- Run Security Analysis
- Validate Policies
- Detect Vulnerabilities
- Produce Security Reports

---

# Permission Levels

Every permission shall define one operational level.

Level 0 — No Access

Level 1 — Read

Level 2 — Analyze

Level 3 — Recommend

Level 4 — Prepare

Level 5 — Execute Approved Tasks

Human approval remains mandatory where governance requires it.

---

# Permission Assignment

Permissions may only be assigned through:

- organizational role;
- certification level;
- governance approval;
- documented authorization.

Implicit permissions are prohibited.

---

# Permission Inheritance

Permissions may inherit downward through organizational hierarchy.

Subholding

Company

Business Unit

Department

Project

Inheritance shall never bypass governance restrictions.

---

# Permission Restrictions

The following permissions are permanently prohibited for AI agents:

- Constitutional Approval
- Governance Approval
- Policy Approval
- Standard Approval
- Human Performance Evaluation
- Organizational Voting
- Executive Decision Making

These authorities remain exclusively human.

---

# Temporary Permissions

Temporary permissions may be granted for:

- audits;
- migration projects;
- incident response;
- controlled experiments.

Every temporary permission shall define:

- approval authority;
- justification;
- activation date;
- expiration date.

---

# Permission Verification

Permission verification shall occur before every protected operation.

Verification shall confirm:

- identity;
- certification;
- operational status;
- organizational scope;
- permission validity.

---

# Permission Revocation

Permissions may be revoked due to:

- certification expiration;
- governance violations;
- security incidents;
- organizational reassignment;
- retirement.

Revocation shall be immediately effective.

---

# Governance as Code

Permission validation should be automatically enforceable whenever technically feasible.

Automation shall validate permissions.

Automation shall never grant permissions autonomously.

---

# Institutional Principle

> Capability determines what an AI agent can perform.

> Permission determines what an AI agent is authorized to perform.

> Governance determines when those permissions may be exercised.

> Human authority grants every permission.
