# AI Agent Runtime Standard

> Official runtime governance standard for Artificial Intelligence Agents operating within Breto's Holding Group.

---

# Purpose

This standard defines the operational rules governing AI agents while they are actively executing within the BHG ecosystem.

Runtime behavior shall remain continuously governed, monitored and auditable.

---

# Guiding Principles

Runtime governance follows:

- Governance First
- Runtime Predictability
- Operational Safety
- Human Oversight
- Continuous Monitoring
- Fail Safe by Default
- Least Privilege
- Governance as Code

---

# Runtime Philosophy

Deployment authorizes execution.

Configuration defines behavior.

Runtime demonstrates compliance.

An AI agent shall continuously prove that it is operating within its approved governance boundaries.

---

# Runtime States

Every AI agent shall operate under one of the following states:

- Initializing
- Ready
- Active
- Waiting
- Paused
- Suspended
- Recovering
- Degraded
- Stopping
- Terminated

State transitions shall be recorded permanently.

---

# Runtime Session

Every execution session shall generate:

- Runtime Session ID
- Agent UUID
- Configuration Version
- Runtime Version
- Environment
- Start Timestamp
- End Timestamp
- Responsible Authority
- Current State

Every runtime session shall remain auditable.

---

# Runtime Controls

Runtime shall continuously enforce:

- Permission validation
- Configuration integrity
- Tool authorization
- Resource allocation
- Security policies
- Governance policies

Violations shall trigger automated responses according to risk level.

---

# Runtime Isolation

Every AI agent shall execute inside an isolated operational boundary.

Isolation shall include:

- Memory isolation
- Tool isolation
- Session isolation
- Secret isolation
- Context isolation

No runtime shall access unauthorized resources.

---

# Runtime Resource Management

The runtime shall monitor:

- CPU usage
- Memory usage
- Context window utilization
- Token consumption
- Execution duration
- Tool execution frequency

Thresholds shall be configurable through governance.

---

# Runtime Health

Operational health shall continuously evaluate:

- Availability
- Responsiveness
- Error Rate
- Resource Consumption
- Dependency Status
- Governance Compliance

Health status shall be classified as:

- Healthy
- Warning
- Critical

---

# Runtime Recovery

Automatic recovery may include:

- Session restart
- Tool reset
- Context reconstruction
- Resource reallocation
- Failover execution

Recovery actions shall be recorded.

---

# Runtime Stop Conditions

Runtime shall immediately stop when:

- Human authority orders termination.
- Critical governance violations occur.
- Security policies are violated.
- Unauthorized configuration drift is detected.
- Certification becomes invalid.
- Risk exceeds approved thresholds.

Emergency stop shall always take precedence.

---

# Runtime Audit

Runtime shall continuously produce:

- Execution events
- Governance events
- Security events
- Configuration events
- Tool usage events
- Decision events

Audit records shall be immutable.

---

# Runtime Governance Gates

Continuous runtime validation shall verify:

## Gate G1

Configuration Integrity

---

## Gate G2

Permission Compliance

---

## Gate G3

Operational Health

---

## Gate G4

Governance Compliance

---

## Gate G5

Human Override Availability

Failure of any critical gate shall activate predefined governance responses.

---

# Governance as Code

Whenever technically feasible, runtime shall automatically verify:

- configuration integrity
- permission consistency
- governance compliance
- runtime health
- policy enforcement
- certification validity
- operational limits

Automated runtime supervision shall never replace human authority.

---

# Institutional Principle

> Runtime is continuous governance in action.

> Every executing agent shall remain observable, accountable and interruptible.

> Organizational trust must persist throughout execution, not only before it begins.
