# Document Update Workflow

## Purpose

This workflow defines the mandatory sequence of activities that every authorized AI agent shall execute before, during and after updating documentation within the BHG ecosystem.

The objective is to produce deterministic, traceable and governance-compliant documentation updates.

---

# Workflow Overview

Every documentation update shall follow the workflow below.

```
Receive Request

↓

Load Repository

↓

Load Governance

↓

Understand Context

↓

Analyze Dependencies

↓

Analyze Impact

↓

Prepare Update Plan

↓

Generate Proposed Changes

↓

Validate References

↓

Validate Metadata

↓

Prepare Commit

↓

Human Review

↓

Approved Implementation

↓

Post-Implementation Validation

↓

Audit Registration

↓

Completed
```

---

# Stage 1 — Receive Request

The AI agent receives an update request.

The request shall include enough information to identify the intended governance objective.

---

# Stage 2 — Load Repository

The AI agent shall inspect:

- repository structure
- directory hierarchy
- documentation layout
- repository standards

No document shall be modified before repository discovery is complete.

---

# Stage 3 — Load Governance

The AI agent shall identify every governance artifact applicable to the requested change.

Governance documents always take precedence over implementation documents.

---

# Stage 4 — Understand Context

The AI agent shall determine:

- document purpose

- document scope

- governance level

- related artifacts

- affected organizational units

---

# Stage 5 — Dependency Analysis

The AI agent shall identify:

- referenced documents

- incoming references

- downstream dependencies

- version dependencies

- governance dependencies

---

# Stage 6 — Impact Analysis

The AI agent shall estimate the impact on:

- governance

- engineering

- documentation

- repositories

- AI systems

- organizational consistency

Impact shall be documented before implementation.

---

# Stage 7 — Update Plan

Before generating modifications, the AI agent shall prepare an implementation plan including:

- objectives

- affected artifacts

- implementation sequence

- validation strategy

- rollback considerations

---

# Stage 8 — Generate Proposed Changes

Changes shall remain:

- minimal

- deterministic

- documented

- governance compliant

The AI agent shall never introduce unrelated modifications.

---

# Stage 9 — Validate References

The AI agent shall verify:

- document references

- filenames

- document hierarchy

- governance relationships

Broken references shall be reported before implementation.

---

# Stage 10 — Validate Metadata

The AI agent shall verify:

- version

- owner

- approval authority

- governance level

- related documents

Metadata inconsistencies shall block implementation.

---

# Stage 11 — Prepare Commit

The AI agent shall generate:

- Conventional Commit

- commit description

- implementation summary

Commit messages shall accurately describe the implemented change.

---

# Stage 12 — Human Review

All governance-related modifications require explicit human approval before implementation.

The AI agent shall pause execution until approval is granted.

---

# Stage 13 — Approved Implementation

Only approved modifications may be applied.

Implementation shall preserve version history and governance consistency.

---

# Stage 14 — Post-Implementation Validation

The AI agent shall verify:

- successful implementation

- reference integrity

- metadata consistency

- repository consistency

- governance compliance

---

# Stage 15 — Audit Registration

The completed operation shall generate an auditable record containing:

- execution timestamp

- updated artifacts

- commit information

- validation results

- implementation outcome

---

# Failure Handling

Whenever validation fails, the workflow shall stop.

The AI agent shall generate a structured report describing:

- detected issue

- affected artifact

- severity

- recommended corrective action

No automatic workaround shall bypass governance requirements.

---

# Governance as Code

This workflow is intentionally structured for automated execution.

Every workflow stage shall be machine-verifiable whenever technically feasible.

---

# Compliance

Documentation updates executed outside this workflow shall be considered automation non-conformities and shall require governance review.
