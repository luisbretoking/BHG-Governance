# AI Agent Monitoring Standard

> Official monitoring governance standard for Artificial Intelligence Agents operating within Breto's Holding Group.

---

# Purpose

This standard establishes the organizational requirements for continuously monitoring AI agents throughout their operational lifecycle.

Monitoring shall provide real-time visibility into operational health, governance compliance, security posture and service availability.

---

# Guiding Principles

Monitoring follows:

- Governance First
- Continuous Visibility
- Early Detection
- Operational Transparency
- Evidence-Based Monitoring
- Automation with Human Oversight
- Traceability by Default
- Governance as Code

---

# Monitoring Philosophy

Every operational event shall be observable.

Every anomaly shall be detectable.

Every alert shall be traceable.

Monitoring exists to preserve organizational trust throughout execution.

---

# Monitoring Scope

Monitoring shall continuously evaluate:

- Runtime Health
- Availability
- Response Time
- Resource Consumption
- Governance Compliance
- Security Compliance
- Tool Usage
- Memory Usage
- Context Utilization
- Error Rates
- Certification Status
- Configuration Integrity

---

# Monitoring Categories

## Operational Monitoring

Continuously monitor:

- Runtime state
- Active sessions
- Service availability
- Recovery events

---

## Performance Monitoring

Continuously measure:

- Response latency
- Throughput
- Token consumption
- Queue utilization
- Resource efficiency

---

## Governance Monitoring

Continuously verify:

- Configuration compliance
- Active certifications
- Required approvals
- Governance gate status
- Policy enforcement

---

## Security Monitoring

Continuously inspect:

- Authentication events
- Authorization failures
- Secret access
- Permission violations
- Security incidents

---

## Behavioral Monitoring

Continuously evaluate:

- Decision consistency
- Tool invocation patterns
- Behavioral drift
- Operational anomalies
- Unexpected execution patterns

---

# Monitoring Levels

Monitoring shall classify observations as:

Level 0 — Informational

Level 1 — Notice

Level 2 — Warning

Level 3 — High Risk

Level 4 — Critical

Each level shall define required escalation actions.

---

# Monitoring Metrics

Every AI agent shall expose measurable indicators including:

- Availability
- Uptime
- Mean Response Time
- Mean Recovery Time
- Failure Rate
- Governance Compliance Score
- Security Events
- Runtime Health Score
- Certification Validity
- Configuration Drift Events

Metrics shall remain historically available.

---

# Monitoring Alerts

Alerts shall include:

- Alert Identifier
- Timestamp
- Agent UUID
- Severity
- Description
- Affected Component
- Recommended Action
- Escalation Level
- Resolution Status

Alerts shall be immutable.

---

# Monitoring Dashboard

Authorized users shall have access to dashboards presenting:

- Operational Status
- Active Alerts
- Runtime Health
- Governance Status
- Security Status
- Performance Indicators
- Certification Status
- Historical Trends

Dashboard visibility shall follow organizational permissions.

---

# Governance Monitoring Gates

Monitoring shall continuously validate:

## Gate G1

Operational Availability

---

## Gate G2

Performance Compliance

---

## Gate G3

Governance Compliance

---

## Gate G4

Security Compliance

---

## Gate G5

Human Oversight Availability

Failure of any critical gate shall trigger predefined governance actions.

---

# Governance as Code

Whenever technically feasible, monitoring shall automatically validate:

- runtime status
- governance compliance
- configuration integrity
- certification validity
- policy enforcement
- operational thresholds
- behavioral consistency

Automation shall generate alerts but shall not replace organizational decision-making.

---

# Institutional Principle

> Monitoring preserves trust through continuous visibility.

> An observable organization is an auditable organization.

> Governance requires continuous awareness, not periodic inspection.
