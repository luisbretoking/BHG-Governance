# AI Agent Observability Standard

> Official observability governance standard for Artificial Intelligence Agents operating within Breto's Holding Group.

---

# Purpose

This standard establishes the organizational requirements for observing, understanding and explaining the behavior of AI agents throughout their operational lifecycle.

Observability shall enable continuous diagnosis, investigation and organizational learning.

---

# Guiding Principles

Observability follows:

- Governance First
- Explainability
- End-to-End Visibility
- Correlation by Default
- Continuous Telemetry
- Organizational Transparency
- Evidence-Based Diagnosis
- Governance as Code

---

# Observability Philosophy

Monitoring answers:

"Is the system operating?"

Observability answers:

"Why is the system behaving this way?"

Observability shall enable understanding beyond predefined monitoring rules.

---

# Observability Pillars

Every AI agent shall expose:

- Metrics
- Logs
- Distributed Traces
- Operational Events
- Governance Events
- Health Signals
- Behavioral Signals

---

# Telemetry

Every runtime shall continuously emit telemetry including:

- Runtime State
- Resource Usage
- Session Activity
- Tool Execution
- Memory Operations
- Decision Flow
- Knowledge Retrieval
- External Calls
- Governance Validation

Telemetry shall be timestamped and correlated.

---

# Distributed Tracing

Every operational request shall generate:

- Trace ID
- Parent Trace
- Span ID
- Agent UUID
- Runtime Session
- Service Name
- Operation
- Duration
- Status

Trace relationships shall remain preserved across multiple agents.

---

# Correlation

Observability platforms shall correlate:

- Runtime Events
- Monitoring Alerts
- Logs
- Metrics
- Traces
- Security Events
- Governance Events
- Human Overrides

Correlation shall support complete operational reconstruction.

---

# Behavioral Analysis

Observability shall continuously analyze:

- Behavioral Drift
- Decision Consistency
- Resource Anomalies
- Collaboration Patterns
- Tool Usage Trends
- Performance Degradation
- Operational Deviations

Behavioral anomalies shall generate governance events.

---

# Root Cause Analysis

The observability platform shall support:

- Incident Reconstruction
- Dependency Analysis
- Failure Propagation
- Configuration Correlation
- Timeline Reconstruction
- Decision Reconstruction

Root causes shall be traceable.

---

# Organizational Dashboards

Dashboards shall provide:

- Fleet Overview
- Runtime Status
- Active Traces
- Governance Health
- Security Overview
- Certification Overview
- Agent Relationships
- Operational Dependencies

Dashboards shall respect organizational permissions.

---

# Observability Governance Gates

Observability shall continuously verify:

## Gate G1

Telemetry Availability

---

## Gate G2

Trace Continuity

---

## Gate G3

Correlation Integrity

---

## Gate G4

Governance Visibility

---

## Gate G5

Audit Reconstruction Capability

Failure of any critical gate shall generate governance alerts.

---

# Governance as Code

Whenever technically feasible, observability systems shall automatically verify:

- telemetry completeness
- trace continuity
- event correlation
- dependency integrity
- anomaly detection
- governance visibility
- operational explainability

Automation may investigate anomalies.

Automation shall never independently determine organizational responsibility.

---

# Institutional Principle

> Visibility creates understanding.

> Understanding enables responsible governance.

> Every operational decision shall remain explainable throughout its lifecycle.
