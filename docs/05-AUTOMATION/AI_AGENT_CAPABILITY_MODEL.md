# AI Agent Capability Model

> Official Capability Framework for AI Agents operating within Breto's Holding Group.

---

# Purpose

This model defines the official capability taxonomy for AI agents operating within the BHG ecosystem.

Every AI agent shall expose its capabilities through this standardized model, enabling consistent governance, authorization, auditing and certification across all repositories.

---

# Design Principles

The capability model is based on the following principles:

- Governance First
- Human Authority
- Least Privilege
- Traceability
- Deterministic Execution
- Vendor Independence
- Explainability

Capabilities shall always be explicitly declared.

Implicit capabilities are prohibited.

---

# Capability Domains

Capabilities are grouped into six operational domains.

## 1. Knowledge

Capabilities related to organizational knowledge.

Examples:

- Read documentation
- Search repositories
- Analyze governance
- Build knowledge graphs
- Detect inconsistencies

---

## 2. Analysis

Capabilities related to reasoning.

Examples:

- Impact analysis
- Dependency analysis
- Risk analysis
- Conflict detection
- Proposal generation

---

## 3. Documentation

Capabilities related to documentation.

Examples:

- Draft documents
- Update documents
- Validate metadata
- Verify references
- Generate changelogs

---

## 4. Engineering

Capabilities related to software engineering.

Examples:

- Review source code
- Generate code
- Detect defects
- Validate standards
- Review architecture

---

## 5. Automation

Capabilities related to automated workflows.

Examples:

- Execute workflows
- Validate pipelines
- Trigger automations
- Verify repository state

Automation capabilities shall never bypass governance.

---

## 6. Governance

Capabilities supporting governance.

Examples:

- Validate compliance
- Detect policy conflicts
- Verify constitutional alignment
- Audit repositories
- Generate governance reports

Governance capabilities never include approval authority.

---

# Capability Levels

Each capability shall be assigned one operational level.

## Level 0

No capability.

---

## Level 1

Read-only capability.

The agent may observe information.

---

## Level 2

Analytical capability.

The agent may interpret information and generate recommendations.

---

## Level 3

Assisted execution.

The agent may prepare implementation artifacts under human supervision.

---

## Level 4

Controlled automation.

The agent may execute pre-approved automated operations.

Human approval remains mandatory whenever governance requires it.

---

## Level 5

Certified autonomous execution.

The agent may execute previously authorized repetitive operations without additional approvals.

Governance modifications are explicitly excluded.

---

# Capability Declaration

Every AI agent shall publish:

- supported capabilities
- capability level
- operational limitations
- required approvals
- audit requirements

---

# Capability Inheritance

Specialized AI agents inherit capabilities from the base organizational model.

Inherited capabilities shall remain subject to governance constraints.

---

# Capability Restrictions

Capabilities shall never imply organizational authority.

Possessing a capability does not grant permission to approve governance decisions.

---

# Future Extensions

New capabilities may be added without modifying this model, provided they comply with its governing principles.

---

# Institutional Principle

> Capabilities define what an AI agent can do.

> Governance defines what an AI agent is allowed to do.

> Human authority defines what finally happens.
