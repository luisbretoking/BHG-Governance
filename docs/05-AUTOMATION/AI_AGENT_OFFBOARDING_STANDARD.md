# Stage 1 — Retirement Request

The process begins with a documented request identifying:

- Reason
- Responsible Authority
- Requested Date
- Organizational Impact

---

# Stage 2 — Evaluation

The request shall evaluate:

- Business impact
- Governance implications
- Security risks
- Operational dependencies
- Active assignments

---

# Stage 3 — Human Approval

The appropriate human authority shall approve or reject the retirement request.

AI agents shall never approve their own offboarding.

---

# Stage 4 — Operational Suspension

The agent shall immediately stop executing operational activities.

No new assignments shall be accepted.

---

# Stage 5 — Permission Revocation

All assigned permissions shall be revoked.

Temporary permissions shall expire immediately.

No privileged access shall remain active.

---

# Stage 6 — Access Revocation

Access shall be removed from:

- Repositories
- APIs
- Services
- Internal Platforms
- Automation Pipelines
- Organizational Resources

---

# Stage 7 — Registry Update

The AI Agent Registry shall update:

- Lifecycle Status
- Operational Status
- Retirement Date
- Responsible Authority
- Retirement Reason

The Agent UUID shall never change.

---

# Stage 8 — Audit Verification

An official audit shall verify:

- Permission revocation
- Access removal
- Registry consistency
- Documentation completeness
- Security compliance

---

# Stage 9 — Historical Archive

Historical information shall remain permanently preserved.

Archived records shall include:

- Identity
- Certifications
- Audit History
- Monitoring History
- Operational History
- Governance Decisions

Historical records shall never be deleted.

---

# Stage 10 — Lifecycle Closure

The lifecycle shall be marked as:

Retired

No further operational activity shall be permitted.

---

# Emergency Offboarding

Immediate offboarding may occur when:

- Critical security incidents
- Governance violations
- Credential compromise
- Regulatory requirements
- Organizational emergency

Emergency actions shall always generate a mandatory post-incident review.

---

# Automation

Automation may perform:

- Permission revocation
- Registry updates
- Documentation generation
- Archive preparation
- Notification workflows

Automation shall never authorize retirement.

---

# Governance as Code

Whenever technically feasible, offboarding validation should be automatically verified.

Human approval remains mandatory before permanent retirement.

---

# Institutional Principle

> Every operational authority eventually ends.

> Access shall disappear before trust is assumed.

> History remains even after operation ends.

> Governance preserves organizational memory.
