# AI Agent Deployment Standard

> Official deployment governance standard for Artificial Intelligence Agents operating within Breto's Holding Group.

---

# Purpose

This standard defines how AI agents shall be deployed across organizational environments while ensuring governance compliance, operational stability, reproducibility and human oversight.

No AI agent shall enter production without completing the approved deployment process.

---

# Guiding Principles

Deployment follows:

- Governance First
- Human Approval
- Controlled Promotion
- Reproducibility
- Traceability
- Operational Stability
- Rollback Readiness
- Security by Design

---

# Deployment Philosophy

Deployment is an organizational authorization process.

Technical readiness alone does not authorize production operation.

---

# Deployment Environments

Every AI agent may operate within the following environments:

## Development

Purpose:

- Design
- Experimentation
- Internal development

Characteristics:

- Low restrictions
- High flexibility
- No production authority

---

## Testing

Purpose:

- Functional validation
- Integration testing
- Automated verification

Characteristics:

- Controlled datasets
- Simulated workflows
- Validation evidence generation

---

## Certification

Purpose:

- Governance validation
- Compliance verification
- Organizational evaluation

Characteristics:

- Certification procedures
- Audit evidence
- Human review

---

## Staging

Purpose:

- Production simulation
- Final operational verification

Characteristics:

- Production-like environment
- Limited access
- Final deployment approval

---

## Production

Purpose:

- Official organizational operation

Characteristics:

- Fully governed
- Continuously monitored
- Audit enabled
- Human accountable

---

# Deployment Requirements

Before deployment every AI agent shall have:

- Approved Change Request
- Current Documentation
- Registered Version
- Valid Certification
- Assigned Responsible Authority
- Security Validation
- Rollback Plan
- Deployment Approval

---

# Deployment Workflow

Deployment shall follow:

```
Development

↓

Testing

↓

Certification

↓

Staging

↓

Human Approval

↓

Production

↓

Continuous Monitoring
```

---

# Promotion Rules

Promotion between environments shall require:

- Successful validation
- Required evidence
- Governance compliance
- Human approval where applicable

No environment shall be skipped.

---

# Rollback

Every production deployment shall define:

- Rollback trigger
- Responsible authority
- Recovery procedure
- Previous certified version
- Expected recovery time

Rollback procedures shall be periodically verified.

---

# Deployment Records

Every deployment shall record:

- Agent UUID
- Deployment ID
- Version
- Environment
- Deployment Date
- Responsible Authority
- Approval Reference
- Rollback Reference
- Deployment Status

Records are permanent.

---

# Continuous Monitoring

After deployment every AI agent shall be monitored for:

- Operational health
- Governance compliance
- Security events
- Performance indicators
- Organizational incidents

Monitoring shall support continuous improvement.

---

# Governance as Code

Whenever technically feasible:

- deployment requirements
- environment validation
- version consistency
- certification status
- approval prerequisites

should be automatically verified before deployment.

Automation may execute deployments.

Only authorized human authorities may approve production deployment.

---

# Institutional Principle

> Production access is earned through governance.

> Deployment authorizes organizational responsibility.

> Every production agent shall be trusted, verified and accountable.
