# AI Agent Configuration Standard

> Official configuration governance standard for Artificial Intelligence Agents operating within Breto's Holding Group.

---

# Purpose

This standard defines how AI agents shall be configured before entering operational environments.

Configuration shall be treated as a governed organizational asset.

---

# Guiding Principles

Configuration management follows:

- Governance First
- Configuration as Code
- Traceability
- Least Privilege
- Reproducibility
- Environment Isolation
- Human Accountability

---

# Configuration Philosophy

Behavior shall be determined through controlled configuration rather than undocumented implementation.

Configuration is part of governance.

---

# Configuration Categories

Every AI agent configuration shall define:

## Agent Identity

- Agent UUID
- Agent Name
- Organizational Owner
- Certification Level

---

## Model Configuration

- Provider
- Model
- Version
- Context Limits
- Reasoning Profile

---

## Operational Configuration

- Execution Mode
- Response Limits
- Retry Policies
- Timeout Policies

---

## Memory Configuration

- Memory Enabled
- Memory Scope
- Retention Policy
- Retrieval Strategy

---

## Tool Configuration

- Authorized Tools
- Tool Permissions
- External Integrations
- Execution Restrictions

---

## Security Configuration

- Authentication Method
- Authorization Scope
- Secret References
- Encryption Requirements

Secrets shall never be stored directly within configuration files.

---

## Governance Configuration

- Governance Level
- Required Approvals
- Certification Status
- Governance Gates
- Audit Level

---

## Logging Configuration

- Log Level
- Audit Events
- Retention Period
- Monitoring Integration

---

## Environment Configuration

Every configuration shall explicitly specify its target environment.

Supported environments include:

- Development
- Testing
- Certification
- Staging
- Production

Environment configurations shall remain isolated.

---

# Configuration Lifecycle

Configurations progress through:

Draft

↓

Reviewed

↓

Approved

↓

Versioned

↓

Released

↓

Active

↓

Deprecated

↓

Archived

---

# Configuration Versioning

Every configuration change shall generate:

- Configuration Version
- Change Identifier
- Responsible Authority
- Approval Record
- Effective Date

Historical configurations shall never be deleted.

---

# Configuration Validation

Before activation every configuration shall pass validation for:

- Syntax
- Integrity
- Governance Compliance
- Permission Consistency
- Security Compliance
- Environment Compatibility
- Dependency Validation

---

# Configuration Governance Gates

Every configuration shall pass:

## Gate G1

Metadata Validation

---

## Gate G2

Security Validation

---

## Gate G3

Permission Validation

---

## Gate G4

Governance Validation

---

## Gate G5

Human Approval

No production configuration may bypass governance gates.

---

# Configuration Registry

Every approved configuration shall be permanently registered.

Minimum registry information includes:

- Configuration ID
- Agent UUID
- Version
- Environment
- Approval Reference
- Effective Date
- Current Status

---

# Governance as Code

Whenever technically feasible, configuration validation shall be automated.

Automation may verify:

- Metadata completeness
- Version consistency
- Security compliance
- Governance compliance
- Dependency integrity
- Configuration syntax

Automation shall never approve production configuration.

Only authorized human authorities may approve production configurations.

---

# Institutional Principle

> Configuration defines predictable behavior.

> Governed configuration produces governed execution.

> Organizational trust begins before runtime.
