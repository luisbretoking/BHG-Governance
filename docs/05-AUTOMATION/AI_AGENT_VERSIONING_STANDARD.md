# AI Agent Versioning Standard

> Official version management standard for Artificial Intelligence Agents operating within Breto's Holding Group.

---

# Purpose

This standard defines how AI agent versions shall be created, identified, documented, approved and maintained throughout their operational lifecycle.

Every operational version shall be uniquely identifiable.

---

# Guiding Principles

Versioning follows:

- Traceability
- Reproducibility
- Governance First
- Documentation First
- Controlled Evolution
- Human Accountability
- Backward Compatibility whenever feasible

---

# Version Philosophy

A version represents the complete operational state of an AI agent at a specific point in time.

Every version shall be reproducible.

---

# Version Identifier

Every operational version shall include:

- Major
- Minor
- Patch

Semantic Versioning shall be adopted.

Example:

```
3.4.2
```

---

# Version Types

## Major

Breaking organizational or operational changes.

Examples:

- Foundation model replacement
- Major architecture redesign
- Organizational reassignment
- Capability redesign

---

## Minor

Backward-compatible functional improvements.

Examples:

- New capabilities
- Workflow improvements
- New integrations
- Documentation enhancements

---

## Patch

Small corrections without changing expected behavior.

Examples:

- Prompt fixes
- Configuration corrections
- Documentation fixes
- Security adjustments

---

# Version Metadata

Every released version shall include:

- Version Number
- Release Date
- Responsible Authority
- Change Request ID
- Agent UUID
- Certification Status
- Deployment Status
- Supporting Documentation

---

# Release Requirements

A new operational version requires:

- Approved Change Request
- Updated Documentation
- Successful Validation
- Audit Verification (if applicable)
- Human Approval

---

# Version History

Every AI agent shall maintain a permanent version history including:

- Previous Versions
- Current Version
- Release Notes
- Change References
- Certification References

History shall never be deleted.

---

# Compatibility

Every version shall define:

- Supported Workflows
- Supported Policies
- Required Dependencies
- Minimum Certification Level

---

# Rollback

Every major and minor release shall include a documented rollback strategy.

Rollback shall restore the previous certified version whenever technically feasible.

---

# Deprecation

Versions may enter:

- Supported
- Maintenance
- Deprecated
- Retired

Deprecated versions shall include an official migration recommendation.

---

# Governance as Code

Version metadata should be machine-readable whenever technically feasible.

Automated systems may validate version consistency.

Human approval remains mandatory for official releases.

---

# Institutional Principle

> Every version represents organizational knowledge.

> Every release shall be reproducible.

> Every evolution shall preserve organizational history.

> Governance gives meaning to every version.
