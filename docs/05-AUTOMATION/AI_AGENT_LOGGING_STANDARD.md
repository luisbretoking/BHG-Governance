# AI Agent Logging Standard

> Official logging governance standard for Artificial Intelligence Agents operating within Breto's Holding Group.

---

# Purpose

This standard establishes how AI agents shall generate, protect, store and manage operational logs throughout their lifecycle.

Logs constitute permanent organizational evidence.

---

# Guiding Principles

Logging follows:

- Governance First
- Evidence by Default
- Traceability
- Immutability
- Integrity
- Confidentiality
- Accountability
- Governance as Code

---

# Logging Philosophy

If an organizational action cannot be reconstructed, it shall be considered unauditable.

Every relevant event shall leave verifiable evidence.

---

# Mandatory Logging Categories

Every AI agent shall generate logs for:

- Runtime Events
- Configuration Changes
- Authentication Events
- Authorization Events
- Governance Events
- Certification Events
- Tool Execution
- Decision Events
- Prompt Processing
- Memory Access
- Knowledge Retrieval
- Security Events
- Error Events
- Recovery Events
- Human Overrides

---

# Log Structure

Every log entry shall contain at minimum:

- Log ID
- Timestamp (UTC)
- Agent UUID
- Runtime Session ID
- Event Category
- Event Type
- Severity
- Description
- Related Resource
- User or Authority
- Environment
- Correlation ID

---

# Log Classification

Logs shall be classified as:

- Operational
- Governance
- Security
- Audit
- Diagnostic
- Compliance
- Performance

Classification shall determine retention and access rules.

---

# Severity Levels

Each log entry shall include one severity level:

- Trace
- Debug
- Information
- Notice
- Warning
- Error
- Critical
- Emergency

Severity definitions shall remain consistent across the ecosystem.

---

# Log Integrity

Logs shall be:

- Immutable
- Tamper-evident
- Chronologically ordered
- Digitally verifiable when applicable

Modification of historical logs is prohibited.

---

# Log Retention

Retention periods shall be defined according to:

- Regulatory requirements
- Organizational policy
- Security classification
- Audit obligations

Expired logs shall be archived or securely disposed of according to governance policies.

---

# Access Control

Log access shall follow least privilege.

Access shall require:

- Authentication
- Authorization
- Audit logging

Every access to logs shall itself generate a log entry.

---

# Privacy and Confidentiality

Logs shall never expose:

- Plaintext secrets
- Authentication credentials
- Encryption keys
- Sensitive personal information unless explicitly authorized

Sensitive values shall be masked or encrypted.

---

# Governance Logging

Governance events shall include:

- Policy approvals
- Certification changes
- Authority decisions
- Human overrides
- Governance gate results
- Exception approvals

These events shall receive the highest audit priority.

---

# Logging Governance Gates

Logging systems shall continuously validate:

## Gate G1

Log Completeness

---

## Gate G2

Integrity Verification

---

## Gate G3

Retention Compliance

---

## Gate G4

Security Compliance

---

## Gate G5

Audit Availability

Failure of critical gates shall generate immediate governance alerts.

---

# Governance as Code

Whenever technically feasible, logging systems shall automatically verify:

- required event coverage
- metadata completeness
- integrity validation
- retention compliance
- unauthorized modifications
- timestamp consistency

Automation may validate logs.

Automation shall never delete protected organizational evidence without authorized governance procedures.

---

# Institutional Principle

> Logs preserve organizational memory.

> Every governed action shall produce governed evidence.

> Organizational trust depends on immutable evidence.
