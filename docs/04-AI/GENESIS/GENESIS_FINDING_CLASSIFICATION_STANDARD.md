# Genesis Finding Classification Standard

## 1. Purpose

This standard defines the official classification model used by Genesis to identify, categorize, prioritize and report repository findings.

Every finding SHALL follow a deterministic classification process.

---

# 2. Finding Definition

A Finding is any verified condition detected by Genesis that affects repository quality, governance, integrity, compliance or certification.

Findings SHALL be supported by repository evidence.

---

# 3. Finding Categories

Genesis SHALL classify findings into one of the following categories:

- Governance
- Documentation
- Architecture
- Engineering
- AI
- Automation
- Security
- Compliance
- Repository Integrity
- Traceability
- Dependencies

A finding SHALL belong to one primary category.

---

# 4. Severity Levels

Every finding SHALL receive one severity level.

| Level | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| INFO | Informational only |
| LOW | Minor improvement recommended |
| MEDIUM | Moderate issue requiring correction |
| HIGH | Significant issue affecting repository quality |
| CRITICAL | Blocks certification or execution |

Severity SHALL be determined using objective repository evidence.

---

# 5. Finding Status

Every finding SHALL contain one lifecycle state.

- Open
- In Progress
- Mitigated
- Resolved
- Accepted Risk

---

# 6. Evidence Requirement

Every finding SHALL include:

- Finding ID
- Category
- Severity
- Description
- Repository Evidence
- Affected Documents
- Recommended Action

Findings without evidence SHALL NOT be reported.

---

# 7. Certification Impact

Certification impact SHALL be classified as:

- None
- Minor
- Moderate
- Major
- Blocking

Blocking findings SHALL prevent repository certification.

---

# 8. Priority Calculation

Genesis SHALL prioritize findings using:

1. Severity
2. Certification Impact
3. Number of affected documents
4. Dependency impact

No subjective prioritization is permitted.

---

# 9. Reporting

Every Repository Report SHALL summarize findings by:

- Category
- Severity
- Certification Impact
- Status

---

# 10. Compliance

Every Genesis Engine producing repository findings SHALL implement this standard.

Alternative finding classification models are prohibited.
