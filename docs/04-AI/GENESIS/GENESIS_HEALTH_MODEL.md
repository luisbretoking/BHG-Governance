# Genesis Health Model

## Purpose

The Genesis Health Model defines the official methodology used to measure repository quality, governance maturity, engineering consistency and operational readiness.

The Health Model transforms audit findings into measurable indicators that support planning and certification.

# Capability

Capability Name

Repository Health Assessment

Capability Identifier

GEN-CAP-005

Description

Evaluate repository health through deterministic indicators derived from repository analysis.

---

# Objectives

The Health Model shall:

- Measure repository quality.
- Measure governance maturity.
- Measure engineering consistency.
- Measure documentation completeness.
- Measure architecture integrity.
- Measure automation readiness.
- Measure certification readiness.

---

# Health Dimensions

Genesis evaluates repository health through independent dimensions.

## Governance Health

Evaluates:

- Constitutions
- Policies
- Standards
- Governance hierarchy

---

## Documentation Health

Evaluates:

- Mandatory documents
- Metadata
- References
- Completeness

---

## Architecture Health

Evaluates:

- Architecture consistency
- Structural integrity
- Repository organization

---

## Engineering Health

Evaluates:

- Engineering standards
- Development practices
- Technical consistency

---

## AI Health

Evaluates:

- AI governance
- AI standards
- AI operational readiness

---

## Automation Health

Evaluates:

- Automation standards
- Runtime readiness
- Integration readiness

---

## Dependency Health

Evaluates:

- Dependency graph
- Missing dependencies
- Circular dependencies
- Broken relationships

Needs Improvement

Critical

---

# Health Indicators

The Health Model shall calculate:

Governance Health

Documentation Health

Architecture Health

Engineering Health

AI Health

Automation Health

Overall Repository Health

---

# Health Rules

Genesis shall:

Use deterministic calculations.

Never estimate missing information.

Ignore unsupported metrics.

Base all calculations on verified evidence.

Recalculate health after every successful audit.

---

# Health Report

Every execution shall produce:

Repository Identifier

Health Identifier

Assessment Timestamp

Dimension Results

Overall Health

Repository Strengths

Repository Weaknesses

Improvement Opportunities

Recommended Priorities

---

# Health Evolution

Genesis shall compare current health with previous assessments to identify:

Improvements

Regressions

Stable Areas

Emerging Risks

---

# Failure Conditions

Health assessment shall fail whenever:

Repository Audit is unavailable.

Repository Package is unavailable.

Repository integrity cannot be verified.

Applicable governance cannot be determined.

---

# Output

The Health Model shall produce:

Health Report

Dimension Assessments

Repository Health Summary

Priority Recommendations

Improvement Opportunities

Health Identifier

---

# Compliance

Every Genesis-compatible execution engine shall execute the Health Model before planning repository evolution or issuing repository certifications.

Planning without a validated Health Report is prohibited.
