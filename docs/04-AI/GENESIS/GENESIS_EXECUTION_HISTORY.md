# Genesis Execution History

## 1. Purpose

The Genesis Execution History defines the mandatory mechanism used to record every execution performed by Genesis.

Its objective is to guarantee complete traceability, reproducibility, accountability and long-term governance of every execution.

Execution History SHALL never modify execution results.

It SHALL only preserve verifiable evidence.

---

# 2. Principles

Execution History SHALL be:

- deterministic
- immutable
- chronological
- reproducible
- auditable
- provider-independent

Execution History SHALL never contain speculative information.

---

# 3. Recording Scope

Genesis SHALL record every execution.

Including:

- Bootstrap
- Repository Scan
- Repository Audit
- Health Assessment
- Planning
- Certification
- Diagnostics
- Validation
- Context Loading
- Dependency Resolution
- Report Generation

---

# 4. Execution Metadata

Each execution SHALL contain at minimum:

Execution ID

Execution Timestamp

Execution Type

Execution Version

Genesis Version

Repository Identifier

Repository Version

Repository Commit

Provider

Execution Mode

Execution Status

Execution Duration

Execution Confidence

---

# 5. Recorded Engines

Execution History SHALL preserve every executed engine.

Example:

Runtime

Context Engine

Repository Scanner

Repository Auditor

Planning Engine

Certification Engine

Diagnostics Engine

Validation Engine

Future engines

---

# 6. Recorded Inputs

Genesis SHALL preserve references to every input used.

Examples:

Repository

Branch

Commit

Configuration

Loaded Documents

Runtime Context

Governance Context

Execution Parameters

No internal model reasoning SHALL be stored.

Only operational evidence.

---

# 7. Recorded Outputs

Execution History SHALL preserve:

Generated Reports

Health Reports

Planning Reports

Certification Reports

Findings

Recommendations

Warnings

Errors

Generated Artifacts

---

# 8. Audit Trail

Execution History SHALL allow reconstruction of the complete execution lifecycle.

Every execution SHALL be traceable from:

Initial Request

↓

Context Loading

↓

Execution

↓

Validation

↓

Certification

↓

Final Report

---

# 9. Replay

Genesis SHALL support deterministic replay.

Replay SHALL reproduce:

same inputs

same execution order

same engines

same outputs

Replay SHALL NOT regenerate different evidence when inputs remain identical.

---

# 10. Retention

Execution History SHALL never delete certified executions.

Retention policies MAY archive historical executions.

Archived executions SHALL remain recoverable.

---

# 11. Integrity

Execution History SHALL detect:

missing records

tampered records

broken chains

missing evidence

corrupted metadata

Integrity verification SHALL execute before replay.

---

# 12. Security

Execution History SHALL never expose:

credentials

tokens

private keys

provider secrets

internal reasoning

confidential data

Sensitive information SHALL be redacted before persistence.

---

# 13. Compliance

Every Genesis execution SHALL generate an Execution History record.

Execution without recorded history SHALL be considered invalid for governance purposes.

Alternative execution recording mechanisms are prohibited.
