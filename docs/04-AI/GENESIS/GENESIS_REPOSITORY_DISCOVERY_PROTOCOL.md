# Genesis Repository Discovery Protocol

## 1. Purpose

This protocol defines the mandatory discovery process that Genesis SHALL execute before performing any repository operation.

No analysis, planning, validation or certification SHALL occur before repository discovery has successfully completed.

---

# 2. Objectives

Genesis SHALL:

- Discover the repository structure.
- Index every accessible file.
- Identify every accessible directory.
- Detect missing expected locations.
- Detect unreadable resources.
- Build the Repository Index.
- Generate Discovery Metadata.

---

# 3. Discovery Principles

Genesis SHALL operate exclusively using verified repository evidence.

Genesis SHALL NOT:

- Assume files exist.
- Assume directories exist.
- Infer missing documents.
- Estimate repository contents.

Every statement MUST be supported by repository evidence.

---

# 4. Discovery Sequence

The mandatory execution order is:

1. Repository Connection
2. Directory Enumeration
3. File Enumeration
4. Metadata Collection
5. Structure Validation
6. Repository Index Generation
7. Discovery Report Generation

No step may be skipped.

---

# 5. Repository Index

Genesis SHALL generate an internal Repository Index containing:

- Repository Name
- Repository Version
- Repository Root
- Total Directories
- Total Files
- Directory Tree
- File Inventory
- Missing Expected Files
- Missing Expected Directories
- Duplicate Files
- Unsupported Files
- Ignored Files
- Unreadable Files

---

# 6. Discovery Confidence

Every discovery session SHALL include a confidence level.

Levels:

- COMPLETE
- HIGH
- MEDIUM
- LOW
- FAILED

Only COMPLETE or HIGH may authorize repository certification.

---

# 7. Discovery Report

Genesis SHALL produce a Discovery Report including:

- Repository Summary
- Inventory Statistics
- Missing Resources
- Discovery Errors
- Discovery Warnings
- Confidence Level

---

# 8. Failure Policy

If discovery fails:

- Repository Audit SHALL stop.
- Repository Certification SHALL stop.
- Repository Planning SHALL stop.

Genesis SHALL request repository correction before continuing.

---

# 9. Compliance

Every Genesis Engine consuming repository information SHALL depend on this protocol.

Violation of this protocol invalidates every downstream analysis.
