# Genesis Execution Runtime

## 1. Purpose

The Genesis Execution Runtime defines the deterministic execution environment used by every Genesis implementation.

Its purpose is to coordinate every execution engine while preserving governance, reproducibility, traceability and provider independence.

The Runtime SHALL never modify governance.

The Runtime SHALL only execute governance.

---

# 2. Mission

The Runtime exists to transform governance specifications into deterministic execution.

Every Runtime execution SHALL produce equivalent outputs when executed with identical inputs.

Provider implementations SHALL never modify Runtime behavior.

---

# 3. Responsibilities

The Runtime SHALL be responsible for:

- Runtime initialization
- Session creation
- Context loading
- Dependency resolution
- Engine scheduling
- Engine execution
- Validation
- Certification orchestration
- Report generation
- Execution history generation
- Runtime shutdown

The Runtime SHALL NOT implement business logic.

---

# 4. Scope

The Runtime governs every Genesis execution.

Including:

- Bootstrap execution
- Repository analysis
- Repository auditing
- Health assessment

- Certification
- Diagnostics
- Report generation
- Future execution engines

The Runtime SHALL remain provider independent.

---

# 5. Runtime Principles

Every Runtime execution SHALL be:

- deterministic
- reproducible
- traceable
- auditable
- immutable
- evidence-based
- governance-driven

Execution SHALL never depend upon provider-specific behavior.

---

# 6. Runtime Architecture

The Runtime is composed of independent execution components.

Each component SHALL have a single responsibility.

Components SHALL communicate only through defined execution contracts.

Direct coupling between engines is prohibited.

---

# 7. Runtime Components

The Runtime consists of:

- Session Manager
- Context Loader
- Dependency Resolver
- Command Resolver
- Engine Scheduler
- Engine Executor
- Validation Coordinator
- Certification Coordinator
- Report Generator
- Execution History Manager
- Shutdown Controller

Additional components MAY be introduced without violating existing contracts.

---

# 8. Runtime Session

Every execution SHALL create exactly one Runtime Session.

A Runtime Session SHALL contain:

- Session Identifier
- Runtime Version
- Genesis Version
- Provider Information
- Repository Information
- Execution Parameters

A session SHALL terminate only after Runtime shutdown.

---

# 9. Runtime Initialization

Initialization SHALL execute before any engine.

Initialization SHALL verify:

- Runtime integrity
- Provider compatibility
- Configuration validity
- Context availability
- Dependency availability
- Governance availability

Initialization failure SHALL terminate execution immediately.

---

# 10. Runtime Context

The Runtime SHALL construct a unified execution context.

The execution context SHALL include:

- Governance Context
- Repository Context
- Runtime Context
- Provider Context
- Session Context
- Execution Context

Every engine SHALL consume the same execution context.

Context duplication is prohibited.

# 11. Runtime Pipeline

Every Runtime execution SHALL follow the same deterministic pipeline.

The pipeline SHALL execute in the following order:

1. Initialize Runtime

2. Create Runtime Session

3. Validate Runtime Integrity

4. Load Governance Context

5. Load Repository Context

6. Resolve Dependencies

7. Resolve Execution Command

8. Select Required Engines

9. Execute Engines

10. Validate Results

11. Generate Reports

12. Execute Certification

13. Persist Execution History

14. Shutdown Runtime

The execution order SHALL NOT be modified.

---

# 12. Dependency Resolution

Before engine execution the Runtime SHALL resolve every dependency.

Dependency resolution SHALL verify:

- required documents
- required engines
- required contexts
- execution contracts
- governance hierarchy
- document authority

Execution SHALL stop if mandatory dependencies cannot be resolved.

---

# 13. Engine Scheduling

The Runtime SHALL schedule engines according to dependency order.

Scheduling SHALL be deterministic.

Execution priority SHALL always follow governance requirements.

Parallel execution MAY occur only when:

- dependencies are independent
- execution order remains deterministic
- produced evidence remains reproducible

Scheduling SHALL never violate dependency rules.

---

# 14. Engine Execution

Each engine SHALL execute independently.

The Runtime SHALL provide:

- execution context
- execution parameters
- dependency information
- required documents
- execution state

Engines SHALL return standardized execution results.

Runtime SHALL never interpret provider-specific outputs.

---

# 15. Runtime State Management

The Runtime SHALL maintain one active execution state.

State transitions SHALL comply with the Genesis State Machine.

Illegal state transitions are prohibited.

The Runtime SHALL validate every transition before execution continues.

---

# 16. Validation Phase

Validation SHALL execute after all required engines finish.

Validation SHALL verify:

- execution completeness
- document integrity
- dependency integrity
- governance compliance
- report consistency
- execution consistency

Validation failure SHALL invalidate the execution.

---

# 17. Report Generation

The Runtime SHALL generate standardized reports.

Reports MAY include:

- Bootstrap Report
- Repository Report
- Health Report
- Audit Report
- Planning Report
- Certification Report
- Diagnostics Report

Reports SHALL remain immutable after generation.

---

# 18. Certification Orchestration

Certification SHALL execute only after:

- validation completed successfully
- mandatory reports generated
- health calculated
- findings classified

The Runtime SHALL invoke the Genesis Certification Engine.

Certification SHALL never execute independently from the Runtime.

---

# 19. Execution History

Every execution SHALL generate exactly one Execution History record.

Execution History SHALL include:

- execution metadata
- executed engines
- execution timestamps
- generated reports
- certification decision
- execution status

History generation failure SHALL invalidate certification.

---

# 20. Runtime Shutdown

Shutdown SHALL execute after every execution.

Shutdown SHALL perform:

- resource cleanup
- session closure
- state finalization
- history verification
- runtime termination

Shutdown SHALL always execute, including after failed executions.

# 21. Runtime Error Management

The Runtime SHALL classify every execution error.

Errors SHALL be categorized as:

- Configuration Errors
- Context Errors
- Dependency Errors
- Validation Errors
- Governance Errors
- Provider Errors
- Engine Errors
- Runtime Errors
- Internal Errors

Each error SHALL receive a unique classification identifier.

---

# 22. Failure Handling

The Runtime SHALL stop execution whenever a blocking failure is detected.

Blocking failures include, but are not limited to:

- missing mandatory governance documents
- unresolved dependencies
- invalid execution contracts
- corrupted execution context
- integrity verification failure
- certification prerequisites not satisfied

The Runtime SHALL NOT continue execution after a blocking failure.

---

# 23. Recovery

When recovery is supported, the Runtime SHALL restore execution from the last valid execution state.

Recovery SHALL preserve:

- execution integrity
- governance compliance
- execution history
- dependency consistency

Recovery SHALL never modify previously generated evidence.

Recovery procedures SHALL be deterministic.

---

# 24. Runtime Memory

The Runtime SHALL maintain temporary execution memory for the duration of the active session.

Runtime Memory MAY contain:

- active execution context
- loaded documents
- dependency graph
- engine outputs
- validation results
- runtime metadata

Runtime Memory SHALL be destroyed after Runtime shutdown unless explicit persistence is required by governance.

---

# 25. Provider Interaction

The Runtime SHALL communicate with providers exclusively through the Provider Abstraction Layer.

The Runtime SHALL NOT:

- invoke proprietary APIs directly
- depend on provider-specific prompt formats
- require vendor-specific capabilities
- modify execution logic based on provider identity

Provider implementations SHALL remain interchangeable.

---

# 26. Execution Guarantees

Every Runtime execution SHALL guarantee:

- deterministic execution
- reproducible outputs
- immutable governance
- evidence-based decisions
- provider independence
- auditability
- traceability
- repeatability
- governance compliance

These guarantees SHALL remain valid regardless of execution environment.

---

# 27. Runtime Constraints

The Runtime SHALL NOT:

- bypass governance hierarchy
- ignore mandatory engines
- invent missing evidence
- modify approved documents
- alter certification decisions
- execute unauthorized commands
- suppress validation failures
- conceal execution errors

Violations SHALL invalidate the execution.

---

# 28. Runtime Compliance

Every Runtime implementation SHALL comply with:

- Genesis Profile
- Genesis Execution Contract
- Genesis Command Protocol
- Genesis Provider Abstraction
- Genesis State Machine
- Genesis Certification Engine
- Genesis Execution History

Partial implementations SHALL declare unsupported capabilities before execution.

---

# 29. Extensibility

The Runtime SHALL support future extensions without breaking existing governance contracts.

Extensions MAY introduce:

- new execution engines
- new execution modes
- new providers
- new diagnostics
- new reporting capabilities
- new orchestration mechanisms

Extensions SHALL preserve backward compatibility whenever technically feasible.

---

# 30. Compliance

No implementation may claim to be a Genesis Runtime unless it fully complies with this specification.

Alternative Runtime implementations SHALL preserve deterministic execution, governance integrity, provider independence and auditability.

Any implementation that violates these requirements SHALL be considered non-compliant.
