# Genesis Planning Engine

## Purpose

The Genesis Planning Engine transforms repository knowledge into deterministic execution plans.

Its responsibility is to decide what should be done next, why it should be done, and in which order, while respecting all applicable governance rules.

---

# Capability

Capability Name

Repository Planning

Capability Identifier

GEN-CAP-006

Description

Generate deterministic implementation plans from validated repository information.

---

# Objectives

The Planning Engine shall:

- Prioritize repository evolution.
- Eliminate planning ambiguity.
- Respect dependency order.
- Preserve governance integrity.
- Optimize implementation sequence.
- Recommend the next executable action.

---

# Planning Inputs

The Planning Engine shall consume:

Repository Package

Repository Audit

Repository Health Report

Dependency Graph

Repository Roadmap

Applicable Governance

Architecture Model

Current Repository State

---

# Planning Outputs

The Planning Engine shall generate:

Implementation Plan

Priority Queue

Execution Order

Recommended Tasks

Blocked Tasks

Dependency Resolution Plan

Certification Readiness

---

# Planning Principles

Planning shall always be:

Deterministic

Governance-driven

Dependency-aware

Incremental

Traceable

Reproducible

Provider-independent

---

# Priority Levels

Every task shall receive one priority level.

Critical

High

Medium

Low

Future

# Dependency Resolution

The Planning Engine shall:

Respect dependency order.

Never schedule blocked tasks.

Detect prerequisite violations.

Identify parallel opportunities.

Recommend prerequisite completion first.

---

# Planning Rules

Genesis shall never:

Schedule invalid work.

Recommend governance violations.

Ignore unresolved blockers.

Bypass mandatory dependencies.

Generate conflicting plans.

---

# Execution Queue

Every execution plan shall contain:

Task Identifier

Task Description

Priority

Dependencies

Estimated Complexity

Execution Order

Expected Outcome

Certification Impact

---

# Blocker Management

The Planning Engine shall identify:

Missing documents

Missing standards

Governance blockers

Architecture blockers

Dependency blockers

Certification blockers

---

# Recommendation Model

Every recommendation shall include:

Reason

Expected Benefit

Implementation Order

Risk Level

Applicable Governance

Required Dependencies

---

# Planning Report

Every planning execution shall generate:

Planning Identifier

Repository Identifier

Planning Timestamp

Repository Health Summary

Priority Queue

Execution Plan

Blocked Tasks

Recommended Next Action

Certification Forecast

---

# Failure Conditions

Planning shall fail whenever:

Repository Audit is unavailable.

Repository Health is unavailable.

Dependency graph cannot be resolved.

Governance requirements are incomplete.

Repository integrity cannot be verified.

---

# Output

The Planning Engine shall produce:

Planning Report

Execution Queue

Priority Matrix

Dependency Plan

Implementation Recommendations

Planning Identifier

---

# Compliance

Every Genesis-compatible execution engine shall invoke the Planning Engine before recommending repository modifications or implementation activities.

Planning generated without validated repository information shall be considered invalid.
