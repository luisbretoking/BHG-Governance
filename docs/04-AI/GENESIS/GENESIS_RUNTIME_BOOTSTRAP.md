# Genesis Runtime Bootstrap

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the mandatory bootstrap sequence executed by Genesis before any operational activity.

No Genesis Engine may execute before the bootstrap has completed successfully.

---

# 2. Bootstrap Objectives

The bootstrap SHALL:

- initialize execution
- establish execution context
- validate governance
- validate repository integrity
- load required engines
- verify execution dependencies

---

# 3. Bootstrap Sequence

Genesis SHALL execute the following sequence exactly.

Phase 01

Initialize Runtime

↓

Phase 02

Load Execution Profile

↓

Phase 03

Load Execution Contract

↓

Phase 04

Load Command Protocol

↓

Phase 05

Initialize Context Engine

# 4. Bootstrap Validation

Genesis SHALL verify:

Execution Profile

Execution Contract

Repository Structure

Governance Documents

Document Metadata

Dependencies

Repository Integrity

Failure of any validation SHALL terminate bootstrap.

---

# 5. Runtime Readiness

Runtime SHALL become READY only when:

Bootstrap completed successfully.

All mandatory engines initialized.

Repository integrity verified.

Execution context established.

---

# 6. Bootstrap Failure

Genesis SHALL immediately terminate initialization if:

mandatory document missing

dependency unresolved

repository corrupted

governance conflict detected

execution contract violated

---

# 7. Bootstrap Output

Successful bootstrap SHALL generate:

Runtime ID

Session ID

Execution Timestamp

Loaded Engines

Loaded Documents

Repository Version

Repository Commit

Bootstrap Status

---

# 8. Compliance

Every Genesis execution SHALL begin with this bootstrap.

Bootstrap cannot be skipped, shortened or reordered.
