# Genesis Repository Scanner

## Purpose

The Genesis Repository Scanner is responsible for discovering, indexing and classifying every repository artifact required for deterministic governance analysis.

The scanner provides Genesis with an accurate representation of the repository before any operational decision is made.

# Capability

Capability Name

Repository Discovery

Capability Identifier

GEN-CAP-003

Description

Build a complete and structured repository model for every execution.

---

# Objectives

The Repository Scanner shall:

- Discover repository structure.
- Identify repository artifacts.
- Classify every artifact.
- Build repository inventory.
- Detect repository anomalies.
- Produce deterministic repository snapshots.

---

# Repository Scope

The scanner shall analyze:

- Directories
- Files
- Metadata
- Documentation
- Standards
- Policies
- Engineering artifacts
- AI artifacts
- Automation artifacts

---

# Repository Model

The scanner shall produce a Repository Model containing:

Repository Identity

Repository Structure

Repository Metadata

Directory Tree

Document Inventory

Dependency Candidates

Architecture References

Governance Assets

Unknown Assets

---

# Artifact Classification

Every discovered artifact shall be classified.

Supported classifications include:

Foundation

Policy

Standard

Engineering

Architecture

Artificial Intelligence

Automation

Governance

Documentation

# Repository Inventory

Every execution shall generate:

Repository Identifier

Repository Name

Repository Version

Directory Count

Document Count

Artifact Count

Supported Standards

Applicable Governance

Detected Categories

Repository Snapshot Identifier

---

# Metadata Resolution

The scanner shall extract metadata from:

YAML headers

Directory hierarchy

File naming conventions

Repository standards

Architecture definitions

Governance specifications

---

# Repository Integrity

The scanner shall verify:

Directory consistency

Naming compliance

Metadata completeness

Duplicate artifacts

Missing mandatory artifacts

Invalid locations

Unexpected structures

---

# Repository Snapshot

Every execution shall produce a deterministic Repository Snapshot containing:

Repository Structure

Artifact Inventory

Metadata Summary

Classification Results

Integrity Findings

Repository Statistics

Snapshot Identifier

---

# Failure Conditions

Scanning shall fail whenever:

Repository root cannot be identified.

Repository structure is corrupted.

Mandatory governance documents are missing.

Repository metadata is invalid.

Repository integrity cannot be established.

---

# Output

The Repository Scanner shall produce:

Repository Package

Repository Snapshot

Artifact Inventory

Repository Statistics

Integrity Report

Classification Report

Repository Identifier

---

# Determinism

Equivalent repositories shall always generate equivalent Repository Packages.

---

# Compliance

Every Genesis execution engine shall invoke the Repository Scanner after successful context resolution.

Repository analysis performed without a Repository Package shall be considered invalid.
