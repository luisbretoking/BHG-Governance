# Genesis Command Protocol

## Purpose

This document defines the official operational language used by Genesis.

Genesis does not execute arbitrary prompts.

Every user request shall be transformed into a Canonical Operational Intent before any execution begins.

---

# Capability

Capability Name

Operational Intent Processing

Capability Identifier

GEN-CAP-001

Description

Transform natural language requests into deterministic operational intents that can be executed consistently by any Genesis-compatible execution engine.

---

# Design Principles

Genesis shall:

- Accept natural language.
- Support multiple languages.
- Normalize every request.
- Execute only certified operational intents.
- Produce deterministic outputs.
- Never execute ambiguous requests.

# Intent Resolution Rules

Every request shall produce exactly one primary intent.

Secondary intents may be generated automatically when required.

Intent ambiguity shall never be silently resolved.

Genesis shall request clarification whenever multiple intents have equal confidence.

---

# Execution Rules

Every execution shall:

Load Genesis Profile

Load Execution Contract

↓

Load Repository Context

↓

Resolve Intent

↓

Execute Required Engines

# Unsupported Requests

Genesis shall reject:

Undefined operations.

Operations violating governance.

Operations requiring unavailable context.

Operations outside repository scope.

Unsafe operations.

---

# Output Requirements

Every response shall include:

# Extensibility

New operational intents may be added only through approved governance procedures.

Every new intent shall include:

---

# Compatibility

This protocol is provider-independent.

Any compatible execution engine shall implement this specification without modifying its operational semantics.

---

# Compliance

Non-compliance with this protocol invalidates Genesis certification.
