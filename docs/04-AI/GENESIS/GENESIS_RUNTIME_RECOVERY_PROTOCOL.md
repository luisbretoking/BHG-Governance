# Genesis Runtime Recovery Protocol

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the mandatory recovery procedure executed whenever Genesis detects a runtime anomaly or execution failure.

Recovery SHALL prioritize repository integrity over execution completion.

---

# 2. Recovery Principles

Genesis SHALL:

- preserve repository integrity
- preserve execution evidence
- stop unsafe execution
- avoid partial operations
- record every recovery action

Recovery SHALL never modify approved governance documents without explicit authorization.

---

# 3. Recovery Triggers

Recovery SHALL start when:

Runtime Failure is detected.

Bootstrap fails.

Repository integrity cannot be verified.

Dependency validation fails.

Certification fails.

Critical diagnostic events are detected.

---

# 4. Recovery Phases

Phase 01

Detect Failure

↓

Phase 02

Freeze Runtime

↓

Phase 03

Preserve Evidence

↓

Phase 04

Record Failure

↓

Phase 05

Evaluate Recovery Possibility

↓

Phase 06

Recover Runtime

or

Terminate Execution

↓

Phase 07

Generate Recovery Report

↓

Recovery Complete

---

# 5. Recovery Modes

Genesis SHALL support:

Soft Recovery

Recover execution without restarting the session.

Hard Recovery

Restart the complete runtime.

Safe Termination

Terminate execution while preserving all evidence.

Manual Recovery

Await authorized human intervention.

---

# 6. Recovery Validation

Before resuming execution Genesis SHALL verify:

Repository integrity

Execution context

Session consistency

Dependency graph

Governance compliance

Runtime state

---

# 7. Mandatory Recovery Metadata

Every recovery event SHALL contain:

Recovery ID

Session ID

Execution ID

Failure ID

Recovery Mode

Recovery Result

Timestamp

Responsible Engine

Recovery Confidence

---

# 8. Recovery Reports

Every recovery SHALL generate:

Failure Summary

Recovery Actions

Recovered Components

Remaining Risks

Evidence References

Final Runtime Status

---

# 9. Failure Escalation

If recovery fails Genesis SHALL:

Terminate execution.

Preserve evidence.

Generate failure report.

Recommend corrective actions.

Transition runtime to FAILED state.

---

# 10. Compliance

Every Genesis-compatible runtime SHALL implement this Recovery Protocol.

Alternative recovery procedures are prohibited.
