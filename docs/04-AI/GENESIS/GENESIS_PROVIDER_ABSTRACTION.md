# Genesis Provider Abstraction

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the provider abstraction layer used by Genesis Runtime.

Its purpose is to guarantee that Genesis remains completely independent from any specific Artificial Intelligence platform.

The runtime SHALL never depend directly on a provider implementation.

---

# 2. Principle

Genesis SHALL execute through standardized capabilities rather than provider-specific features.

Providers SHALL adapt themselves to Genesis.

Genesis SHALL NOT adapt itself to providers.

---

# 3. Provider Independence

Genesis SHALL remain provider-agnostic.

The execution model SHALL produce equivalent governance decisions regardless of:

- provider
- model
- API
- interface
- execution environment

Provider-specific behavior SHALL NOT modify governance decisions.

---

# 4. Supported Provider Categories

Genesis MAY execute through:

- Cloud AI Providers
- Local Language Models
- Enterprise AI Systems
- IDE Integrations
- Autonomous Agents
- Future compatible providers

Provider categories SHALL remain extensible.

---

# 5. Required Capabilities

Every provider SHALL support:

Repository analysis

Document reading

Structured reasoning

Instruction execution

Deterministic report generation

Context preservation

Long-document processing

Dependency reasoning

Governance compliance

Evidence-based outputs

---

# 6. Optional Capabilities

Providers MAY additionally support:

Code generation

Branch creation

PR generation

Issue management

Tool execution

Repository automation

Memory persistence

Semantic search

Workflow execution

---

# 7. Forbidden Dependencies

Genesis SHALL NOT depend on:

specific APIs

specific prompts

specific SDKs

provider proprietary features

closed execution behaviors

vendor-specific implementations

---

# 8. Provider Responsibilities

Providers are responsible only for execution.

Providers SHALL NOT:

modify governance

change authority hierarchy

override certification

change document authority

invent governance

reinterpret constitutional rules

---

# 9. Runtime Contract

The Runtime SHALL communicate with providers exclusively through the Provider Abstraction Layer.

All engines SHALL consume standardized capabilities.

No engine SHALL directly invoke provider-specific behavior.

---

# 10. Capability Negotiation

Before execution Genesis SHALL determine provider capabilities.

Capabilities SHALL be classified as:

Required

Optional

Unavailable

Execution planning SHALL consider capability availability.

---

# 11. Compatibility Levels

Genesis defines four compatibility levels.

Level 1

Read-only execution.

Level 2

Analysis execution.

Level 3

Implementation execution.

Level 4

Autonomous execution under governance approval.

Providers SHALL declare their supported level.

---

# 12. Compliance

A provider SHALL be considered Genesis Compatible only after satisfying every mandatory capability defined in this document.

Compliance SHALL be deterministic, reproducible and independently verifiable.
