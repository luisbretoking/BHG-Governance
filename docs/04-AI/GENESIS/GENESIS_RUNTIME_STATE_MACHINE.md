# Genesis Runtime State Machine

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the official runtime state machine governing every Genesis execution session.

Every runtime transition SHALL be deterministic, traceable and reproducible.

---

# 2. Principles

Genesis SHALL exist in one and only one runtime state at any given moment.

State transitions SHALL occur only through approved transition rules.

Direct transitions outside this specification are prohibited.

---

# 3. Runtime States

The official runtime states are:

OFFLINE

↓

BOOTSTRAPPING

↓

READY

↓

ANALYZING

↓

PLANNING

↓

EXECUTING

↓

VALIDATING

↓

CERTIFYING

↓

REPORTING

↓

COMPLETED

Alternative state:

FAILED

---

# 4. State Definitions

## OFFLINE

Genesis is inactive.

No execution is allowed.

---

## BOOTSTRAPPING

Runtime initialization.

Loading execution profile.

Loading governance.

Loading repository.

---

## READY

Bootstrap completed successfully.

Waiting for execution commands.

---

## ANALYZING

Repository inspection.

Metadata discovery.

Dependency analysis.

Health analysis.

---

## PLANNING

Execution plan generation.

Priority calculation.

Dependency resolution.

---

## EXECUTING

Authorized actions are executed.

Execution remains governed by the Execution Contract.

---

## VALIDATING

Execution output is verified.

Integrity is checked.

Dependencies are revalidated.

---

## CERTIFYING

Certification Engine evaluates compliance.

Certification decision is generated.

---

## REPORTING

Execution report is generated.

Certification report is finalized.

---

## COMPLETED

Execution finished successfully.

Runtime becomes available for a new session.

---

## FAILED

Execution terminated due to validation failure.

Manual intervention may be required.

after a new execution session.

---

# 6. Invalid Transitions

Genesis SHALL NOT:

Skip runtime states.

Repeat completed states.

Return to previous states.

Execute parallel runtime states.

---

# 7. Runtime Integrity

Every state transition SHALL record:

State ID

Timestamp

Session ID

Execution ID

Responsible Engine

Transition Result

---

# 8. Failure Handling

Whenever a failure occurs Genesis SHALL:

Stop execution.

Preserve execution evidence.

Record failure reason.

Generate failure report.

Maintain repository integrity.

---

# 9. Compliance

Every Genesis runtime implementation SHALL implement this state machine without modification.
