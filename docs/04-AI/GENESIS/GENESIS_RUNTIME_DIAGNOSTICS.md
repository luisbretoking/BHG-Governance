# Genesis Runtime Diagnostics

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the official runtime diagnostics model used by Genesis to detect, classify and report execution anomalies.

Diagnostics SHALL continuously evaluate runtime integrity before, during and after execution.

---

# 2. Diagnostic Principles

Genesis SHALL:

- detect anomalies automatically
- preserve execution integrity
- classify diagnostic events
- generate evidence
- recommend corrective actions

Diagnostics SHALL NOT modify repository contents.

---

# 3. Diagnostic Scope

Diagnostics SHALL monitor:

Execution Runtime

Bootstrap

Repository Discovery

Repository Health

Dependency Resolution

Validation

Certification

Reporting

Session Context

Execution History

---

# 4. Diagnostic Categories

Every diagnostic event SHALL belong to one category.

Runtime

Repository

Governance

Dependencies

Integrity

Performance

Configuration

Execution

Certification

Infrastructure

---

# 5. Severity Levels

Each diagnostic SHALL be classified as:

INFO

LOW

MEDIUM

HIGH

CRITICAL

Severity SHALL be evidence-based.

---

# 6. Mandatory Diagnostic Information

Every diagnostic SHALL contain:

Diagnostic ID

Session ID

Execution ID

Runtime State

Category

Severity

Affected Engine

Description

Evidence

Recommended Action

Timestamp

---

# 7. Diagnostic Lifecycle

Every diagnostic SHALL progress through one lifecycle state.

Detected

Confirmed

Under Investigation

Resolved

Accepted Risk

Closed

---

# 8. Runtime Health Monitoring

Genesis SHALL continuously verify:

Runtime availability

Execution consistency

Dependency integrity

Repository accessibility

Governance compliance

Session integrity

---

# 9. Diagnostic Reports

Diagnostic reports SHALL include:

Detected events

Severity summary

Affected components

Recommended remediation

Execution impact

Confidence level

---

# 10. Compliance

Every Genesis-compatible runtime SHALL implement this diagnostic model.

Alternative diagnostic methodologies are prohibited.
