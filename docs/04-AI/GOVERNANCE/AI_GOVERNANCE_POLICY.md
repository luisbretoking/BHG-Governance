# AI Governance Policy

> Defines the governance framework for Artificial Intelligence systems operating within the Breto's Holding Group ecosystem.

---

# Purpose

This policy establishes the official governance framework for all Artificial Intelligence systems operating within the BHG ecosystem.

Its purpose is to ensure that Artificial Intelligence remains:

* Safe.
* Auditable.
* Transparent.
* Predictable.
* Human-governed.
* Legally compliant.
* Aligned with institutional principles.

Artificial Intelligence provides capabilities.

Governance provides authority.

AI systems shall never replace institutional decision-making authority.

---

# Scope

This policy applies to every Artificial Intelligence capability developed, integrated, operated or maintained within the BHG ecosystem.

Including:

* Large Language Models (LLMs).
* AI Agents.
* Prompt Systems.
* Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Systems.
* Automated AI Workflows.
* Autonomous Agents.
* AI APIs.
* Local Models.
* Fine-tuned Models.
* Multi-Agent Systems.

No AI capability shall operate outside the governance framework defined by this policy.

---

# Governance Principles

Every Artificial Intelligence system shall comply with the following principles.

---

## Human Authority

Critical decisions shall never be exclusively delegated to Artificial Intelligence.

Human governance authorities retain final approval responsibility.

---

## Transparency

AI-generated outputs shall be distinguishable from human-generated content whenever required by operational, legal or governance requirements.

---

## Auditability

Every relevant AI operation shall maintain sufficient traceability.

Audit records should include:

* timestamp;
* model identifier;
* prompt version;
* workflow version;
* execution identifier;
* responsible system.

---
## Explainability

Artificial Intelligence systems should provide sufficient context to allow human review of relevant outputs and decisions.

Opaque AI behavior shall be minimized, especially in systems that influence:

* governance decisions;
* financial operations;
* security processes;
* user trust;
* institutional knowledge.

---

## Security

Artificial Intelligence systems shall operate under approved security controls.

AI systems shall respect:

* authentication requirements;
* authorization boundaries;
* least privilege principles;
* zero trust principles;
* data protection requirements.

Artificial Intelligence shall never bypass institutional security mechanisms.

---

## Privacy

Artificial Intelligence systems shall protect confidential and personal information.

Data processing shall comply with:

* approved privacy policies;
* access control requirements;
* data classification rules;
* applicable legal requirements.

---

## Documentation First

No Artificial Intelligence capability shall be implemented without documented governance requirements.

Before deployment, every AI capability shall define:

* purpose;
* scope;
* risks;
* ownership;
* operational requirements;
* lifecycle expectations.

---

# AI Decision Authority Levels

Artificial Intelligence capabilities shall be classified according to their decision authority level.

---

## Level 0 — Information Support

Purpose:

Provide information without making decisions.

Examples:

* summarization;
* search assistance;
* translation;
* information organization.

No autonomous action is performed.

---

## Level 1 — Recommendation

Purpose:

Provide suggestions or analysis.

Human review and approval are mandatory before execution.

Examples:

* recommendations;
* prioritization;
* analysis reports.

---

## Level 2 — Assisted Execution

Purpose:

Execute approved actions under human supervision.

Human approval is required before execution.

Examples:

* controlled workflows;
* operational automation;
* approved repository changes.

---

## Level 3 — Limited Autonomous Execution

Purpose:

Execute predefined low-risk workflows.

Allowed only when:

* scope is explicitly approved;
* permissions are restricted;
* monitoring exists;
* rollback capability exists.

---

## Level 4 — Critical Autonomous Operations

Purpose:

Operations with significant institutional impact.

Critical autonomous execution is prohibited unless explicitly authorized through governance approval.

---

# AI Provider Governance

Only approved Artificial Intelligence providers may be integrated into the BHG ecosystem.

Approved providers shall be maintained through controlled governance records.

Provider evaluation shall consider:

* security;
* reliability;
* privacy;
* compliance;
* technical capabilities;
* operational risks.

Examples of approved providers may include:

* OpenAI;
* Anthropic;
* Google;
* Microsoft;
* approved local models.

---

# Prompt Governance

Production prompts shall be treated as controlled governance assets.

Every production prompt shall maintain:

* unique identifier;
* owner;
* version;
* change history;
* review history;
* approval status.

Unversioned production prompts are prohibited.

---

# AI Agent Governance

Every AI Agent shall define:

* objective;
* responsibilities;
* permissions;
* available tools;
* escalation rules;
* failure behavior;
* audit requirements.

AI Agents shall operate only within their authorized capability boundaries.

---

# Workflow Governance

Every AI workflow shall define:

* trigger conditions;
* inputs;
* outputs;
* validation requirements;
* rollback procedures;
* monitoring requirements.

Workflows shall be designed for controlled execution and auditability.

---

# Memory Governance

AI memory shall be classified according to retention and operational purpose.

Official categories:

## Temporary Memory

Short-lived information used only during immediate execution.

---

## Session Memory

Information maintained during a specific interaction context.

---

## Persistent Memory

Information retained across multiple interactions according to approved policies.

---

## Organizational Memory

Institutional knowledge governed as a controlled BHG asset.

---

Each memory category shall define:

* retention period;
* access requirements;
* ownership;
* deletion or archival rules.

---

# 16. Review

This policy shall be reviewed periodically and updated whenever governance requirements evolve.

---

# Governance Integration

This policy integrates with the broader BHG governance ecosystem.

AI governance decisions shall maintain compatibility with:

* Governance Model.
* Authority Model.
* Document Policy.
* Document Metadata Standard.
* Security Governance.
* Change Management.
* Audit Framework.

AI governance shall never operate as an isolated discipline.

It shall remain aligned with institutional governance principles.

---

# AI Governance Lifecycle

Every Artificial Intelligence capability shall follow a controlled lifecycle:

1. Proposal.
2. Documentation.
3. Risk Assessment.
4. Governance Review.
5. Approval.
6. Implementation.
7. Monitoring.
8. Audit.
9. Improvement or Retirement.

No AI capability shall bypass this lifecycle.

---

# AI Governance Records

Every governed AI system shall maintain sufficient records to reconstruct:

* purpose;
* ownership;
* configuration;
* permissions;
* decisions;
* executions;
* changes;
* incidents;
* audit history.

Records shall remain available according to applicable retention policies.

---

# Artificial Intelligence Authority Limitation

Artificial Intelligence systems may:

* analyze information;
* generate recommendations;
* detect patterns;
* identify risks;
* assist governance processes.

Artificial Intelligence systems shall never:

* create institutional authority;
* approve governance changes;
* override human decisions;
* modify governance artifacts without authorization.

Human governance authority remains the final decision mechanism.

---

# Continuous Improvement

AI governance shall evolve through:

* evidence;
* operational experience;
* security findings;
* technological changes;
* regulatory developments;
* governance reviews.

Every improvement shall preserve traceability and institutional consistency.

---

# Final Principle

Artificial Intelligence is a strategic capability of the ecosystem.

Its value depends on controlled implementation, responsible operation and alignment with the governance principles of Breto's Holding Group.
