# Document Rendering Standard

> Defines the canonical rendering process that transforms validated governance documents into presentation-ready representations while preserving institutional semantics and traceability.

---

# Purpose

Rendering converts the canonical document model into a visual representation suitable for publication, review and distribution.

Rendering shall never modify institutional meaning.

It only determines presentation.

---

# Objectives

The rendering framework shall:

- preserve institutional semantics;
- ensure visual consistency;
- support multiple output formats;
- separate content from presentation;
- enable deterministic rendering;
- support automated publication.

---

# Rendering Principles

Rendering shall be:

- Deterministic
- Stateless
- Reproducible
- Format Independent
- Machine Verifiable
- Human Readable

---

# Rendering Pipeline

Rendering shall occur after:

1. Parsing
2. Grammar Validation
3. Schema Validation
4. Dependency Resolution
5. Governance Validation
6. Canonical Compilation

Only validated documents may be rendered.

---

# Canonical Rendering Model

Every document shall first be converted into an internal canonical representation.

The rendering engine shall never operate directly on raw Markdown.

The canonical model becomes the single rendering source.

---

# Rendering Responsibilities

The rendering engine shall:

- build document structure;
- apply layout rules;
- resolve references;
- generate navigation;
- assign numbering;
- produce visual hierarchy;
- preserve traceability metadata.

---

# Rendering Components

The rendering process includes:

- Header Renderer
- Metadata Renderer
- Section Renderer
- Table Renderer
- Diagram Renderer
- Reference Renderer
- Footer Renderer
- Navigation Renderer

Each component shall be independently replaceable.

---

# Formatting Rules

Rendering shall preserve:

- heading hierarchy;
- numbering;
- spacing;
- typography rules;
- code formatting;
- tables;
- quotations;
- institutional callouts.

---

# Cross Reference Rendering

Cross references shall automatically generate:

- document title;
- section title;
- anchor links;
- dependency links;
- governance indicators.

Broken references shall prevent publication.

---

# Visual Consistency

Every rendered document shall follow a common visual identity.

Presentation differences shall never modify document semantics.

---

# Accessibility

Rendered documents shall support:

- semantic headings;
- keyboard navigation;
- screen readers;
- scalable typography;
- accessible tables.

Accessibility is mandatory.

---

# Rendering Metadata

Rendering shall preserve:

- document identifier;
- version;
- governance level;
- publication status;
- approval authority;
- compilation hash;
- rendering timestamp.

---

# AI Compatibility

Artificial Intelligence may:

- preview rendering;
- detect layout inconsistencies;
- optimize presentation;
- verify rendering integrity.

Artificial Intelligence shall not alter institutional content during rendering.

---

# Governance as Code

Rendering shall be deterministic.

The same canonical document shall always generate the same rendered output under the same rendering configuration.

---

# Extensibility

Additional rendering targets may be introduced without modifying institutional content.

The rendering architecture shall remain modular.

---

# Institutional Principle

> Content defines governance.

> Rendering defines presentation.

Institutional authority always resides in the content, never in its visual appearance.
