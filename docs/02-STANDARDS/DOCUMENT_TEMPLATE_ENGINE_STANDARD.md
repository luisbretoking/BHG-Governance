# Document Template Engine Standard

> Defines the official template engine responsible for transforming canonical governance data into standardized institutional documentation.

---

# Purpose

The Document Template Engine provides the standardized mechanism used to transform structured governance data into complete institutional documents.

The engine guarantees consistency, repeatability, traceability and automation across every document produced within the BHG ecosystem.

---

# Objectives

The template engine shall:

- Standardize document generation.
- Eliminate manual formatting inconsistencies.
- Reduce documentation effort.
- Support Governance as Code.
- Ensure deterministic document generation.
- Maintain institutional identity.

---

# Core Principles

The template engine shall be:

- Deterministic
- Declarative
- Modular
- Extensible
- Machine Readable
- Human Readable
- Technology Independent
- Version Controlled

---

# Engine Architecture

The engine consists of five logical layers.

## Layer 1 — Input

Receives canonical document schemas.

Supported inputs include:

- YAML
- JSON
- Structured Metadata

---

## Layer 2 — Template Resolution

Selects the appropriate template according to:

- document type
- governance level
- domain
- version
- classification

---

## Layer 3 — Content Assembly

Assembles all required sections.

Including:

- Metadata
- Purpose
- Principles
- Governance
- Responsibilities
- Institutional Principle

Optional sections shall be inserted only when permitted by the grammar.

---

## Layer 4 — Rendering

Transforms the assembled document into supported formats.

Reference implementations may include:

- Markdown
- HTML
- PDF
- DOCX

Additional renderers may be implemented without modifying governance rules.

---

## Layer 5 — Validation Hooks

Before output generation the engine shall invoke:

- Grammar Validation
- Schema Validation
- Dependency Resolution
- Authority Verification

Documents failing validation shall not be rendered.

---

# Template Components

Templates shall be composed of reusable blocks.

Examples include:

- Metadata Block
- Purpose Block
- Governance Block
- Principle Block
- Requirement Block
- Institutional Principle Block

Reusable components shall avoid duplication.

---

# Template Versioning

Templates shall be versioned independently from documents.

Each template shall include:

- Template Identifier
- Version
- Compatibility
- Supported Schema Versions

---

# Deterministic Generation

Given the same:

- schema
- template
- version

the engine shall always produce the same document.

No stochastic behavior shall modify institutional documentation.

---

# AI Compatibility

Artificial Intelligence systems may invoke the template engine.

AI systems shall not modify templates directly.

Template modifications require formal governance approval.

---

# Governance as Code

The engine shall support automated:

- document generation
- template validation
- metadata injection
- dependency mapping
- authority verification

Automation shall accelerate documentation while preserving governance authority.

---

# Extensibility

Organizations may define additional template families provided they remain compatible with:

- Document Grammar Standard
- Document Schema Standard

---

# Institutional Principle

> Consistent documents are generated from consistent knowledge.

> Templates standardize expression while governance preserves meaning.
