# 1. Purpose

The Genesis Validation Engine evaluates whether a document complies with the governance framework established by Breto's Holding Group.

The Validation Engine validates compliance.

It SHALL never interpret document syntax, modify documents, or generate documentation.

---

# 2. Mission

Guarantee that every document satisfies the governance, engineering and documentation standards required by the BHG ecosystem.

---

# 3. Scope

The Validation Engine SHALL:

- validate governance rules;
- evaluate mandatory policies;
- verify required references;
- validate authority relationships;
- detect compliance violations;
- generate compliance reports.

The Validation Engine SHALL NOT:

- parse documents;
- validate document schemas;
- resolve dependencies;
- modify content;
- compile documentation.

---

# 4. Input

The Validation Engine SHALL receive:

- Parsed Document Object (PDO)
- Schema Validation Report (SVR)

Documents that fail schema validation SHALL NOT proceed to governance validation.

---

# 5. Output

The engine SHALL produce a Governance Validation Report (GVR).

Every report SHALL contain:

- validation identifier;
- document identifier;
- governance status;
- detected violations;
- warnings;
- recommendations;
- compliance score.

---

# 6. Validation Domains

The engine SHALL validate:

- governance compliance;
- document authority;
- mandatory references;
- document metadata consistency;
- version compatibility;
- naming conventions;
- document lifecycle requirements;
- certification prerequisites.

---

# 7. Rule Registry

Every validation rule SHALL define:

- rule identifier;
- description;
- severity;
- evaluation criteria;
- expected outcome;
- remediation guidance.

---

# 8. Validation Categories

Validation SHALL include:

- Constitutional Compliance
- Governance Compliance
- Engineering Compliance
- Documentation Compliance
- AI Governance Compliance

Each category SHALL be evaluated independently.

---

# 9. Compliance Levels

Validation results SHALL be classified as:

- Fully Compliant
- Compliant with Warnings
- Partially Compliant
- Non-Compliant
- Critical Non-Compliance

Critical Non-Compliance SHALL terminate the execution pipeline.

---

# 10. Violation Severity

Violations SHALL be classified as:

- Information
- Warning
- Minor
- Major
- Critical

Severity SHALL determine pipeline behavior.

---

# 11. Rule Evaluation

Every applicable rule SHALL be evaluated.

Validation SHALL be deterministic.

Rule execution order SHALL not affect validation results.

---

# 12. Reporting

Every Governance Validation Report SHALL include:

- executed rules;
- passed rules;
- failed rules;
- skipped rules;
- compliance percentage;
- required corrective actions.

---

# 13. Security

The Validation Engine SHALL never:

- modify governance rules;
- bypass mandatory validation;
- alter compliance reports;
- ignore critical violations.

---

# 14. Extensibility

New validation rules SHALL be added through the Governance Rule Registry.

Core engine logic SHALL remain unchanged.

---

# 15. Certification Requirements

A certified implementation SHALL demonstrate:

- deterministic rule evaluation;
- reproducible compliance reports;
- complete rule coverage;
- traceable validation history;
- accurate severity classification.

---

# 16. Compliance

The Validation Engine SHALL comply with:

- BHG Constitution;
- Governance Model;
- Genesis Architecture;
- Genesis Runtime;
- Genesis Parser Engine;
- Genesis Schema Engine;
- Engineering Constitution.

---

# 17. Final Provisions

The Genesis Validation Engine is the exclusive governance compliance evaluator of the Genesis Bootstrap architecture.

No document SHALL advance beyond validation while containing unresolved Critical Non-Compliance findings.
