# 1. Purpose

The Genesis Runtime is the execution kernel of Genesis.

It coordinates every engine participating in the Bootstrap process while remaining completely independent from business rules and document-specific logic.

The Runtime never decides.

The Runtime executes.

---

# 2. Mission

Provide a deterministic, auditable and governance-compliant execution environment for every Genesis engine.

---

# 3. Responsibilities

The Runtime SHALL:

- initialize execution sessions;
- load execution context;
- resolve engine execution order;
- invoke engines;
- propagate execution state;
- collect execution results;
- manage failures;
- produce execution reports.

The Runtime SHALL NOT:

- interpret governance;
- modify documents;
- generate content;
- approve changes;
- bypass governance.

---

# 4. Core Principles

The Runtime SHALL be:

- deterministic;
- stateless between executions;
- modular;
- auditable;
- reproducible;
- extensible;
- implementation-independent.

---

# 5. Runtime Components

The Bootstrap Runtime consists of:

Execution Controller

↓

Context Manager

↓

Pipeline Manager

↓

Engine Dispatcher

↓

Result Collector

↓

Execution Reporter

---

# 6. Execution Pipeline

Every execution SHALL follow the same sequence.

Initialize

↓

Load Context

↓

Validate Request

↓

Resolve Dependencies

↓

Execute Engines

↓

Collect Results

↓

Generate Report

↓

Terminate Execution

---

# 7. Execution Context

Every execution SHALL include:

- execution identifier;
- timestamp;
- repository identifier;
- branch;
- governance version;
- runtime version;
- engine versions;
- requester;
- execution mode.

---

# 8. Execution Modes

Supported modes:

- Validation
- Compilation
- Rendering
- Export
- Automation
- Full Pipeline

---

# 9. Engine Invocation

The Runtime SHALL invoke engines only through standardized interfaces.

No engine may invoke another engine directly.

All communication SHALL pass through the Runtime.

---

# 10. Dependency Resolution

The Runtime SHALL determine execution order before execution begins.

Circular dependencies SHALL terminate execution.

---

# 11. Error Management

Errors SHALL be classified as:

- Information
- Warning
- Recoverable Error
- Critical Error

Critical errors SHALL immediately terminate execution.

---

# 12. Reporting

Every execution SHALL generate:

- execution summary;
- engines executed;
- execution duration;
- detected errors;
- warnings;
- generated artifacts;
- governance compliance status.

---

# 13. Security

The Runtime SHALL never:

- execute arbitrary code;
- bypass governance;
- modify protected documents;
- ignore validation failures.

---

# 14. Extensibility

New engines may be registered without modifying the Runtime.

Registration SHALL occur through the official engine registry.

---

# 15. Certification Requirements

A Runtime implementation SHALL demonstrate:

- deterministic execution;
- reproducible outputs;
- complete audit logs;
- governance compliance;
- dependency validation;
- error isolation.

---

# 16. Compliance

Every Runtime implementation SHALL comply with:

- BHG Constitution;
- Genesis Architecture;
- Engineering Constitution;
- AI Constitution.

---

# 17. Final Provisions

The Genesis Runtime is the only authorized execution coordinator of the Genesis Bootstrap system.

No Bootstrap engine may operate outside the Runtime execution lifecycle.
