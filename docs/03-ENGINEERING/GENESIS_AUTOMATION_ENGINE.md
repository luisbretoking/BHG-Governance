# 1. Purpose

The Genesis Automation Engine orchestrates the complete Bootstrap documentation pipeline.

It coordinates execution without modifying governance rules, documentation content or certification decisions.

Automation SHALL always remain deterministic, auditable and governance-driven.

---

# 2. Mission

Provide automated execution of the Genesis documentation lifecycle while preserving complete governance compliance and execution traceability.

---

# 3. Scope

The Automation Engine SHALL:

- orchestrate execution pipelines;
- invoke Runtime execution;
- schedule execution sequences;
- coordinate engine dependencies;
- monitor execution status;
- generate automation reports.

The Automation Engine SHALL NOT:

- modify source documents;
- bypass governance validation;
- bypass Runtime;
- alter certification results;
- approve documentation.

---

# 4. Input

The Automation Engine SHALL receive:

- execution requests;
- execution configuration;
- Runtime availability;
- repository state;
- pipeline definition.

---

# 5. Output

The Automation Engine SHALL produce:

- Automation Execution Report (AER);
- execution logs;
- pipeline status;
- execution metrics;
- generated artifacts summary.

---

# 6. Automation Pipeline

Every automated execution SHALL follow:

Execution Request

↓

Pipeline Selection

↓

Runtime Initialization

↓

Parser Engine

↓

Schema Engine

↓

Validation Engine

↓

Dependency Engine

↓

Compiler Engine

↓

Render Engine

↓

Export Engine

# 7. Execution Modes

Supported Bootstrap modes:

- Full Pipeline
- Validation Only
- Compilation Only
- Rendering Only
- Export Only
- Custom Pipeline

---

# 8. Execution Scheduling

The Automation Engine SHALL support:

- manual execution;
- scheduled execution;
- event-driven execution;
- repository-triggered execution.

Bootstrap implementations MAY initially support only manual execution.

---

# 9. Pipeline Coordination

The Automation Engine SHALL:

- verify prerequisites;
- verify engine availability;
- enforce execution order;
- stop on critical failures;
- preserve execution traceability.

---

# 10. Failure Handling

Failures SHALL be classified as:

- Information
- Warning
- Recoverable Failure
- Critical Failure

Critical failures SHALL terminate pipeline execution.

---

# 11. Automation Report

Every execution SHALL generate:

- execution identifier;
- pipeline executed;
- engines executed;
- execution duration;
- generated artifacts;
- warnings;
- failures;
- final execution status.

---

# 12. Auditability

Every automated execution SHALL be completely traceable.

The Automation Engine SHALL maintain:

- execution history;
- execution timestamps;
- engine sequence;
- generated reports;
- execution outcomes.

---

# 13. Security

The Automation Engine SHALL never:

- bypass Runtime;
- bypass Validation Engine;
- execute uncertified engines;
- ignore critical failures;
- modify governance rules.

---

# 14. Extensibility

Future automation capabilities SHALL be implemented through Automation Providers.

The orchestration core SHALL remain implementation independent.

---

# 15. Performance Requirements

The Automation Engine SHALL be:

- deterministic;
- reproducible;
- modular;
- scalable;
- fault tolerant.

---

# 16. Certification Requirements

A certified implementation SHALL demonstrate:

- deterministic orchestration;
- complete execution traceability;
- correct pipeline coordination;
- reproducible execution;
- complete automation reporting.

---

# 17. Compliance

The Automation Engine SHALL comply with:

- BHG Constitution;
- Governance Model;
- Genesis Architecture;
- Genesis Runtime;
- every Bootstrap Engine;
- Engineering Constitution.

---

# 18. Final Provisions

The Genesis Automation Engine is the exclusive orchestration authority for the Genesis Bootstrap architecture.

Every automated documentation process SHALL be executed exclusively through the official Genesis Runtime and SHALL follow the certified Bootstrap pipeline.
