# 1. Purpose

The Genesis Export Engine transforms Rendered Documentation Models (RDM) into distributable documentation artifacts while preserving integrity, traceability and certification metadata.

The Export Engine SHALL never modify rendered content.

---

# 2. Mission

Produce deterministic documentation packages suitable for storage, publication and distribution across the BHG ecosystem.

---

# 3. Scope

The Export Engine SHALL:

- export rendered documentation;
- generate supported output formats;
- preserve metadata;
- preserve document identifiers;
- preserve traceability information;
- generate export manifests.

The Export Engine SHALL NOT:

- modify rendered models;
- validate governance;
- compile documentation;
- render layouts;
- publish exported artifacts.

---

# 4. Input

The Export Engine SHALL receive:

- Rendered Documentation Model (RDM)

Only certified rendered models SHALL be exported.

---

# 5. Output

The Export Engine SHALL produce one or more Export Documentation Artifacts (EDA).

Every EDA SHALL include:

- artifact identifier;
- export format;
- export timestamp;
- version;
- integrity metadata;
- export manifest.

---

# 6. Supported Export Formats

Bootstrap SHALL support:

- Markdown (.md)

Future versions MAY support:

- HTML
- PDF
- DOCX
- JSON
- XML
- EPUB

---

# 7. Export Pipeline

Every export SHALL follow:

Rendered Model Loading

↓

Integrity Verification

↓

Format Adapter Selection

↓

Artifact Generation

↓

Artifact Verification

↓

Manifest Generation

↓

Export Documentation Artifact

---

# 8. Export Integrity

Every exported artifact SHALL preserve:

- document identifiers;
- metadata;
- version information;
- authority references;
- cross references;
- document structure.

---

# 9. Export Manifest

Every export SHALL generate an Export Manifest containing:

- export identifier;
- source artifact;
- output format;
- exported files;
- generation timestamp;
- integrity status.

---

# 10. Export Errors

Export issues SHALL be classified as:

- Information
- Warning
- Recoverable Error
- Critical Error

Critical errors SHALL terminate export.

---

# 11. Export Report

Every export SHALL generate:

- exported artifacts;
- selected format;
- execution duration;
- integrity verification;
- warnings;
- errors.

---

# 12. Security

The Export Engine SHALL never:

- alter certified content;
- bypass integrity verification;
- export corrupted artifacts;
- access unauthorized resources.

---

# 13. Extensibility

New export formats SHALL be implemented through Export Adapters.

The export core SHALL remain independent of output formats.

---

# 14. Performance Requirements

The Export Engine SHALL be:

- deterministic;
- reproducible;
- scalable;
- modular;
- implementation independent.

---

# 15. Certification Requirements

A certified implementation SHALL demonstrate:

- deterministic exports;
- artifact integrity;
- metadata preservation;
- reproducible output;
- complete export manifests.

---

# 16. Compliance

The Export Engine SHALL comply with:

- BHG Constitution;
- Governance Model;
- Genesis Architecture;
- Genesis Runtime;
- Genesis Compiler Engine;
- Genesis Render Engine;
- Engineering Constitution.

---

# 17. Final Provisions

The Genesis Export Engine is the exclusive authority responsible for generating distributable documentation artifacts within the Genesis Bootstrap architecture.

Every exported document SHALL originate from a certified Rendered Documentation Model.
