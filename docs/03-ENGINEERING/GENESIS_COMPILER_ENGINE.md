# 1. Purpose

The Genesis Compiler Engine transforms validated documentation into certified documentation artifacts.

Compilation SHALL occur only after successful parsing, schema validation, governance validation, and dependency analysis.

The Compiler SHALL never modify source documents.

---

# 2. Mission

Produce deterministic, complete and reproducible documentation artifacts ready for rendering, export and certification.

---

# 3. Scope

The Compiler SHALL:

- collect validated documents;
- resolve dependency order;
- merge document components;
- generate compiled artifacts;
- preserve traceability;
- produce compilation reports.

The Compiler SHALL NOT:

- edit source documents;
- validate governance;
- resolve schema errors;
- render output formats;
- publish documentation.

---

# 4. Input

The Compiler SHALL receive:

- Parsed Document Objects (PDO)
- Schema Validation Reports (SVR)
- Governance Validation Reports (GVR)
- Dependency Analysis Reports (DAR)

Compilation SHALL stop if any critical validation remains unresolved.

---

# 5. Output

The Compiler SHALL produce a Compiled Documentation Artifact (CDA).

Every CDA SHALL include:

- compilation identifier;
- artifact version;
- compilation timestamp;
- included documents;
- dependency manifest;
- compilation status;
- traceability metadata.

---

# 6. Compilation Pipeline

Compilation SHALL follow this sequence:

Input Collection

↓

Eligibility Verification

↓

Dependency Ordering

↓

Document Assembly

↓

Integrity Verification

↓

Artifact Generation

↓

Compilation Report

# 7. Compilation Rules

The Compiler SHALL:

- preserve document order;
- preserve metadata;
- preserve references;
- preserve identifiers;
- preserve version history.

Compilation SHALL never introduce undocumented changes.

---

# 8. Artifact Integrity

Every artifact SHALL be verified for:

- completeness;
- consistency;
- dependency integrity;
- metadata preservation;
- identifier uniqueness.

---

# 9. Traceability

Every compiled artifact SHALL maintain:

- source document identifiers;
- source versions;
- compilation identifier;
- dependency lineage;
- governance lineage.

---

# 10. Compilation Errors

Compilation issues SHALL be classified as:

- Information
- Warning
- Recoverable Error
- Critical Error

Critical errors SHALL terminate compilation.

---

# 11. Compilation Report

Every compilation SHALL generate:

- processed documents;
- skipped documents;
- compilation duration;
- detected issues;
- generated artifacts;
- integrity verification results.

---

# 12. Security

The Compiler SHALL never:

- compile unvalidated documents;
- bypass dependency verification;
- modify approved content;
- suppress compilation failures.

---

# 13. Extensibility

Support for additional artifact types SHALL be implemented through compiler extensions.

Core compilation logic SHALL remain stable.

---

# 14. Performance Requirements

The Compiler SHALL be:

- deterministic;
- reproducible;
- implementation independent;
- scalable;
- modular.

---

# 15. Certification Requirements

A certified implementation SHALL demonstrate:

- deterministic compilation;
- reproducible artifacts;
- complete traceability;
- dependency preservation;
- integrity verification.

---

# 16. Compliance

The Compiler SHALL comply with:

- BHG Constitution;
- Governance Model;
- Genesis Architecture;
- Genesis Runtime;
- Genesis Parser Engine;
- Genesis Schema Engine;
- Genesis Validation Engine;
- Genesis Dependency Engine;
- Engineering Constitution.

---

# 17. Final Provisions

The Genesis Compiler Engine is the exclusive authority responsible for generating Compiled Documentation Artifacts within the Genesis Bootstrap architecture.

Every rendered or exported document SHALL originate from a certified Compiled Documentation Artifact.
